# Introduction {.unnumbered #sec-intro}

This book does not aim at providing an exhaustive presentation of the theory of random medium homogeneization (see [@milton2002], [@torquato2002] or [@kachanov2018] among others) but it is rather intended to recall some of the basic notations and results related to the implementation of the **Echoes** library.
