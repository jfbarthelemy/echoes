  abstract = {Molecular diffusion is an important mechanism for gas transport in various natural and man-made systems. This is particularly the case with soil covers installed on acid-generating mine tailings, where oxygen availability has to be controlled. One of the most important roles of such covers is to limit gas flux, which depends on the effective diffusion coefficient D e of the cover materials. This paper presents an experimental procedure and results from oxygen diffusion tests performed on different types of materials, at various degrees of saturation. The determination of D e in the laboratory from the test data is based on analytical and numerical solutions to Fick's laws. The ensuing values of D e are compared to values calculated from available models that relate D e to basic material properties, including porosity and degree of saturation. Statistical indicators are used to evaluate the accuracy of selected models, individually and on a comparative basis. It is shown that modified versions of the Millington-Quirk (M-Q) and Millington-Shearer (M-S) models provide D e values close to the measured data. A semi-empirical expression, ensuing from these models and measurements, is proposed as a simple means of estimating D e.},

The Callovo-Oxfordian argillite is considered here in the context of feasibility studies for geological storage of nuclear waste storage. Based on the microstructural analysis, a micromechanical model is first proposed using nonlinear homogenization techniques for heterogeneous materials. The argillite is seen as a three phase composite with elastoplastic clay matrix, elastic damaged calcite grains and elastic quartz grains. Using the proposed model, the variations of elastic and plastic properties of material with mineralogical compositions at different depths are systematically taken into account. Comparisons between experimental data and model's predictions are presented. The proposed model, implemented into a finite element computation code, is finally applied to the analysis of excavation of a vertical shaft.},

  abstract = {Subcommittee 4 of RILEM TC 107-CSP has established recommendations for shrinkage and creep tests. These recommendations are based on physical and mechanical analysis of these tests, to ensure that they provide reproducible and objective results. However, the complete specification of these tests must also make it possible to respond to diversified needs: in particular, industrial users (contractors, suppliers of materials, etc.) are increasingly led to request such tests, and the type of experimental data they expect can be quite different from what is expected by people who draft regulations or develop numerical models. This paper therefore presents, in a first part, thinking about these needs, which are found to be highly varied and rapidly evolving. In a second part, we review the importance of the scale effect that makes it tricky to attempt any extrapolation of the available experimental results in two directions (to the long-term and to large thickness). In the absence of a satisfactory explanation of this scale effect, a practical method is proposed that can be used to get round this difficulty experimentally and to deal with certain engineering problems.},

  abstract = {Carbonate formations are highly heterogeneous, and the velocity-porosity relationships are controlled by various microstructural parameters, such as the types of pores and their distribution. Because diagenesis is responsible for important changes in the microstructure of carbonate rocks, we have extended the standard effective medium approach to model the impact of diagenesis on the carbonate elastic properties through a step-by-step effective medium modeling. Two different carbonate rocks deposited, respectively, in lacustrine and marine environments are considered in this study. The first key step is the characterization of the diagenesis, which affected the two studied carbonate sample sets. Effective medium models integrating all of the geologic information accessible from petrographic analysis are then built. The evolution of the microstructural parameters during diagenesis is thoroughly constrained based on an extensive experimental data set, including X-ray diffraction analysis, different porosimetry methods, and ultrasonic velocity measurements. A new theoretical approach including two sources of compliance is developed to model the specific behavior of carbonates. A compliant interface is introduced around the main carbonate grains to represent grain contacts and the different pore scales are taken into account through multiscale modeling. Finally, direct calculations with the model provide elastic wave velocities representative of the different diagenetic stages. An extrapolation to permeability evolution is also introduced. This approach allows the identification of the acoustic signature of specific diagenetic events, such as dolomitization, dissolution, or cementation, and the assessment of their impact on the elastic properties of carbonates.},

Local mechanical properties of phases such as the attached mortar, the interfacial transition zones (ITZ) and the aggregates are also investigated by means of indentation tests at nano and microscale. Finally, experimentally informed multi scale model is established and the overall elastic modulus and chloride diffusion coefficient of concretes (with different rates of RCA) are computed and compared to experimental results at macroscopic scale for discussion.

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to formulate a micromechanics-based approach to non-aging viscoelastic behavior of materials with randomly distributed micro-fractures. Unlike cracks, fractures are discontinuities that are able to transfer stresses and can therefore be regarded from a mechanical viewpoint as interfaces endowed with a specific behavior under normal and shear loading. Making use of the elastic-viscoelastic correspondence principle together with a Mori-Tanka homogenization scheme, the effective viscoelastic behavior is assessed from properties of the material constituents and damage parameters related to density and size of fractures. It is notably shown that the homogenized behavior thus formulated can be described in most cases by means of a generalized Maxwell rheological model. For practical implementation in structural analyses, an approximate model for the isotropic homogenized fractured medium is formulated within the class of Burger models. Although the approximation is basically developed for short-term and long-term behaviors, numerical applications indicate that the approximate Burger model accurately reproduce the homogenized viscoelastic behavior also in the transient conditions. \textcopyright 2018 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In design practice, the long-term delayed strain of concrete is decomposed into four components: autogenous shrinkage, basic creep, drying shrinkage and drying creep. The four components are first computed separately and then summed up to obtain the total delayed strain of concrete, without wondering about any potential correlation between them. In this work, we aim at modeling the total delayed strain in a unified manner, without assuming this decomposition a priori. Such model is derived in the framework of viscoelastic poromechanics. The influence of relative humidity on the creep properties is taken into account. We assume that drying creep is due to the fact that the mechanical consequences of capillary effects are larger in loaded drying specimens than in non-loaded drying specimens. The model is validated by comparing the prediction with experimental results of delayed strain from the literature and discussed with respect to existing models.},

In this paper, micromechanical modeling has been performed to study the relationship between individual material properties, their interaction within the microstructure, and the macroscopic properties of HMA mix. The analytical model based on N phase self-consistent scheme allows calculating the complex modulus and phase angle of HMA mixes from the mechanical properties of its constituents and designed mix data. In the mix microstructure, aggregates and sand are classified using simple sieve analysis test. Asphalt and sand mastic film thicknesses around the aggregates are calculated for each class and introduced into the model.},

We prove that if for a single nonzero uniform loading the strain inside inclusion is constant and further the eigenvalues of this strain are either all the same or all distinct, then the inclusion must be of ellipsoidal shape. As a consequence, we show that for two linearly independent loadings the strains inside the inclusions are uniform, then the inclusion must be of ellipsoidal shape. We then use this result to address a problem of determining the shape of an inclusion when the elastic moment tensor (elastic polarizability tensor) is extremal. We show that the shape of inclusions, for which the lower Hashin-Shtrikman bound either on the bulk part or on the shear part of the elastic moment tensor is attained, is an ellipse in two dimensions and an ellipsoid in three dimensions. Nous progressons dans la r\'esolution de la conjecture d'Eshelby en trois dimensions.

For the measurement, it is common to use a four-point probe with four equally spaced electrodes (spacing distance a) and convert the measured resistance R into apparent resistivity with the so-called Wenner expression, ?app = 2paR. By means of experimental measurements and model simulations, the present study confirmed that the application of this formula is adequate, even if most of the assumptions underlying its derivation are violated. The reasons for this are systematically discussed. The experimental results also indicate that measurements with common four-point setups overestimate the resistivity with respect to bulk resistivity measurements. This is likely due to the presence of coarse aggregates that distort the current field at the sense electrodes.},

While it is generally assumed that improving chloride ingress models will improve the prediction of the time-to-corrosion, this paper shows that the bottle neck to more reliable predictions are rather i) the lack of fundamental understanding of corrosion initiation, ii) the use of non-representative laboratory results, and iii) ignoring the size-effect in localized corrosion.},

  abstract = {This work aims to determine the compactness/density of hot mix asphalt by measuring its permittivity by means of step-frequency radar. As hot mix asphalt (HMA) is mainly made of rocks; their dielectric properties are measured in the frequency range of 0.5 - 4 Ghz with step-frequency radar, using cylindrical cavities. The results show that the rocks can be considered as low-loss dielectric. As electromagnetic mixing models are required to translate measured permittivity to the compactness, power law models and unified mixing rules are needed for laboratory experimental data. The slab permittivity of various compactness is determined with the help of the step-frequency radar system. This study shows that: (i) the selection of the electromagnetic mixing model has a critical impact on the accuracy of the calculated compactness; (ii) the choice of the host matrix for a family of unified mixing rules has huge consequences; and (iii) the best assessment of compactness/density is given by the complex refractive index model and Rayleigh and B\"ottcher models with an aggregate matrix.},

  abstract = {Cathodic protection is unique among all the methods of corrosion control in that, if required, it is able to stop corrosion completely, but it remains within the choice of the operator to accept a lesser, but quantifiable, level of protection. Manifestly, it is an important and versatile technique. In principle, cathodic protection can be applied to all the so-called engineering metals. In practice, it is most commonly used to protect ferrous materials and predominantly carbon steel. It is possible to apply cathodic protection in most aqueous corrosive environments, although its use is largely restricted to natural, near-neutral environments (soils, sands, and waters, each with air access). Thus, although the general principles outlined here apply to virtually all metals in aqueous environments, it is appropriate that the emphasis, and the illustrations, relate to steel in aerated natural environments. The text seeks to show why cathodic protection is apparently so restricted in its scope of application despite its apparent versatility. Nevertheless, having recognized the restricted scope, it is important to emphasize that the number and criticality of the structures to which cathodic protection is applied is very high indeed. \textcopyright{} 2010 Copyright \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The hydration temperature has a considerable effect on the microstructure of cement paste. The microstructural changes with increasing curing temperature result in a significant decrease of cement mechanical properties. The present work aims at studying these phenomena via micromechanical modelling, based on an experimental characterization of cement microstructure. The pore structure of a class G oil-well cement paste (American Petroleum Institute classification) hydrated at different temperatures, between 7 \textdegree C and 90 \textdegree C is characterized. Then, the influence of the microstructure variations on the elastic properties of the hardened paste is explored through micromechanical modelling. A previous analysis of the microstructure enabled determining the volume fractions of different phases of a class G cement paste hydrated under different temperatures [1]. A multiscale self-consistent homogenization model is used based on these results to simulate the variations of the mechanical properties with hydration temperature. The results are compared with macro-scale elastic properties obtained from uniaxial compression tests. It is shown that the increasing capillary porosity with elevating hydration temperature, is not sufficient to fully explain this drop of elastic properties. The latter originates mainly from the decrease of the elastic properties of the foam composed of the porous C-S-H intermixed with capillary pores. The pore structure analysis coupled with the micromechanical modelling permitted a back-analysis of the intrinsic porosities of high density and low density C-S-H showing an almost constant LD intrinsic porosity and a significantly decreasing HD intrinsic porosity.},

Whereas the solution of this problem usually requires the calculation of the so-called fourth-order Hill polarization tensor if the ellipsoid is not singular, it is shown that the crack compliance can be derived from the first-order term in the Taylor expansion of the Hill tensor with respect to the smallest aspect ratio of the ellipsoidal inclusion. For a 3D ellipsoidal crack model, this first-order term is expressed as a simple integral thanks to the Cauchy residue theorem. A similar method allows to express the same term in the case of a cylindrical crack model without any integral. A numerical example is finally treated.},

  abstract = {This work aims at putting in evidence the coupled effects of both delayed de- formations of concrete and relaxation of prestressing steel on the long term behavior of long span bridges. After recalling the possible origins of delayed deformations of pre- stressed concrete structures, the example of the Savines bridge is presented. This 65- year-old bridge shows excessive deflections at mid-spans which can not be predicted by the current Eurocode 2 creep laws, unless artificial coefficients are adjusted. Then a simplified prestressed cantilever beam is considered allowing to quasi-analytically address the problem of interaction between concrete creep and steel relaxation. The resolution of this problem with ageing material laws which are adapted from Eurocode 2 highlights the importance of the evolution of steel tendons after decades and allows to question the validity of laws used in models and the difficulty to identify the contri- butions of concrete and steel in the evolution of the deflection.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of the estimation of the diffusive and mechanical properties of hardened cement pastes by means of a simplified multi-coated sphere assemblage model. This model relies on a microstructure description involving the main hydrated products (portlandite, C-S-H, and aluminous compounds) and accounts for the physical properties of each phase as well as their volume fraction and to a certain extent their size and relative disposition. The basic idea is that any initial cement grain hydrates partly to form an external (outer) layer of C-S-H and partly an internal (inner) layer of C-S-H, both having different properties. The multi-coated sphere model, due to Hashin for its 2-phase version, is then used and applied to calculate the diffusion coefficient and Biot coefficient of such an assemblage. The evolutions of the diffusive properties when the initial material is subjected to lixiviation and calcite formation are estimated on the basis of simplified description of these degradation mechanisms; the issue of expansion due to internal pressure generated by crystal growing (crystallization pressure) in the context of sulfate attack is also analyzed. \textcopyright 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Compared with the formula developed in 1979 by Ba\v{z}ant and Kim, the new formula prevents any violation of the thermodynamic requirement of nonnegativeness of the relaxation function. It is significantly more accurate for long-time relaxation of concrete loaded at a young age, and, for this reason, it is particularly useful for compliance functions that correctly describe multidecade creep, which is the case for model B3 compliance function (a 1995 international RILEM recommendation) and not, for example, for the compliance functions of the American, European, Japanese, and Canadian standard recommendations, for which the benefit is smaller. The main application of the new formula is to evaluate the aging coefficient of the age-adjusted effective modulus method (AAEM...},

  abstract = {Abstract A new time-incremental internal variables homogenization scheme for Maxwellian linear viscoelastic heterogeneous materials is proposed. This scheme is based on the exact solution of the ellipsoidal Eshelby inclusion problem obtained in the time domain. In contrast with current existing methods, the effective behavior as well as the evolution laws of the averaged stresses per phase are solved incrementally in the time domain without need to analytical or numerical inverse Laplace\textendash Carson transforms. This is made through a time-differential equation in addition to the more classic strain rate concentration equation. In addition, the new derived interaction law for the Eshelby inclusion problem is provided in a compact matrix form.

  abstract = {The formulation of the poroelastoplastic constitutive equations at large strains of a fully saturated material is performed focusing on the usually ignored influence of large strain plasticity on the poroelastic properties. A micromechanics approach allows to take into account the evolution of the microstructure geometry which in turn induces a coupling between elasticity and plasticity. Such a coupling results in an additional term in the macroscopic Cauchy stress rate equation derived from inclusion-based estimates that leads to a modified Jaumann derivative. The pressure rate equation is also analysed. The finite element discretization of finite poroplasticity is then presented taking into account the elasticity-plasticity coupling. Application to the consolidation situation shows that the coupling may lead to non-negligible effects. Copyright \textcopyright 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {3D finite element simulations have been performed in order to assess the ability of five classical micromechanical estimates to model the elastic behavior of solids with parallel cracks, namely the dilute, Mori-Tanaka, self-consistent and differential schemes and the Ponte-Castaneda and Willis bounds. The cracks have been represented in the simulations by right circular cylinders with aspect ratios as low as 10-3 and with centroids randomly located in the REV. Special attention has been paid to the crack aspect ratio variation predicted by the different schemes, since the goal is ultimately to propose a non-linear micromechanical model of a cracked solid, taking complete crack closure into account. The results confirm earlier studies which showed that the differential scheme was best suited for this kind of morphology when computing elastic moduli, but additionally, we show that changes in crack aperture are also accurately predicted. It is however noted that the randomness in the positions of the cracks leads to significant scatter in the magnitude of the aperture variation inside a given simulation, which suggests that the cracks do not close simultaneously. As a consequence, non-linear numerical simulations accounting for contact between the crack lips should be performed in order to completely validate a non-linear micromechanical model in alternate tension/compression loading cases.},

The proposed approach has been developed in the general frame of anisotropic thermal behavior per phase and arbitrary ellipsoidal inclusions. Based on the Green's function technique, a new formulation of the problem of multi-coated inclusion is proposed. This formulation consists in constructing a system of integral equations, each associated to the thermal conductivity of each coating and the reference medium. Thanks to the concept of interior- and exterior-point Eshelby's conduction tensors, the exact solution of the problem of multicoated inclusion is obtained. Analytical expressions of the intensity in each phase and the effective thermal conductivity of the composite, through homogenizations schemes such as Generalized self-consistent and Mori-Tanaka models are provided. Results of the present model are successfully compared with those issued from both analytical models and finite elements methods for composites with doubly coated inclusions. Moreover, the developed micromechanical model has been applied to a three phase composite materials in order to analyze combined effects of the aspect ratio and the volume fraction of the ellipsoidal inclusions, the anisotropy of the thermal conductivity of interphase, the thermal conductivity contrast between local phases on the predicted effective thermal conductivity.},

It enables the construction of classes of orthotropic materials for which the Green tensor can be computed in a closed form (closed-form orthotropic or CFO) for any direction within the space. The cases of transversely isotropic, tetragonal and cubic materials are studied as special cases. The comparison between the exact Green function and approximate Green functions obtained from the nearest CFO material (in the sense of four different distances) is finally performed in the case of five examples of elasticity tensors. \textcopyright 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The studied sample comes from a Dogger outcrop of Paris Basin and has the particularity to have a bimodal porosity distribution, with an equal proportion of intragranular microporosity and intergranular macroporosity. In addition to ultrasonic measurements, two different stress-strain methods have been used in a triaxial cell to derive all the elastic moduli at various differential pressures. The first method consists of hydrostatic stress oscillations (f{$\in$}[0.004;0.4] Hz), using the confining pressure pump, from which the bulk modulus was deduced. The second method consists of axial oscillations (f{$\in$}[0.01;10] Hz), using a piezoelectric oscillator on top of the sample, from which Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio were deduced. With the assumption of an isotropic medium, the bulk modulus (K) and the shear modulus (G) can also be computed from the axial oscillations. The sample was studied under dry, glycerin- and water-saturated conditions, in order to scale frequency by the viscosity of the fluid. Results show a dispersion at around 200 Hz for water-saturated conditions, affecting all the moduli except the shear modulus. This dispersion is related to the drained/undrained transition, and the bulk modulus deduced from the axial and hydrostatic oscillations are consistent with each other and with Biot-Gassmann's equations. No dispersion has been detected beyond that frequency. This was interpreted as the absence of squirt flow or local diffusion between the microporous oolites and the macropores.},

Particular anisotropic distributions of patterns can also be considered: Hashin-Shtrikman-type bounds for anisotropic media are then generated. The resolution of the homogenization problem leads to a complex composite inclusion problem with no analytical solution in the general case. Here it is solved by a numerical procedure based on the finite element method. As an example of possible application, this procedure is used to derive new bounds for matrix-inclusion composites with cubic symmetry as well as for transversely isotropic materials.},

It allows also to derive new generalized Voigt/Reuss and Hashin-Shtrikman bounds and generalized self-consistent estimates. This theory is first described and then applied to some particular matrix-inclusion type materials. An important step in the derivation of such bounds or estimates is the computation of the stress and strain fields in an arbitrary heterogeneous inclusion embedded in an infinite medium subjected to homogeneous loading at infinity. Since this problem usually has no known analytical solution, it is solved by a numerical procedure based on the finite elements method. This procedure is first tested on Hashin's 'Composite Sphere Assemblage', for which analytical solutions are known; 2D and 3D meshes are used. It is then extended to materials with ellipsoidal inclusions, for which new bounds and estimates are derived.},

Solids 44 (6) (1996) 827) to generate estimates of the self-consistent type for the effective behaviour of fcc and hcp viscoplastic polycrystals. The method has the distinctive property that it leads to estimates that are exact to second-order in the heterogeneity contrast, and which are expected to be more accurate, particularly when compared to rigorous bounds, than those resulting from earlier homogenisation schemes such as the Hill "incremental" method or its "total" formulation (Hutchinson) for pure power-law viscous materials. Special attention is paid to large grain anisotropy leading to correspondingly large heterogeneity contrast, and to highly nonlinear behaviour. Comparisons are also carried out with estimates derived from other more recent homogenisation schemes such as the "tangent" and "affine" methods. The results, illustrated for zirconium- and ice-type polycrystals, show that the second-order procedure offers the potential for significantly improved results, at least relative to the Hill incremental formulation. \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

These materials are viewed as composites of the Hashin-Shtrikman type with a large number of anisotropic phases and a 'granular' topology. We show that the estimation of the intra-phase stress and strain (rate) second moments comes down to the resolution of a linear system of equations. Applied to a linear viscous face-centred cubic (FCC) polycrystal, it is observed that significant local slip rates are estimated even when the corresponding Schmid factor vanishes, due to the intergranular interactions. For the application to viscoplastic polycrystals, the secant and affine nonlinear extensions of the self-consistent scheme are compared. At large stress sensitivity (n = 30), it is observed that the secant linearization leads to almost uniform slip rates for all slip systems in every phase, whereas the affine approach predicts a much larger spread. Furthermore, there is no one-to-one relation between the phase-average stress (or strain rate) and the corresponding second moment. It is emphasized that intra-phase strain-rate heterogeneities should be accounted for when dealing with microstructure evolution. \textcopyright 2004 The Royal Society.},

  abstract = {We present a new auxiliary problem for the determination of the apparent stiffness of a Statistical Volume Element (SVE). The SVE is embedded in an infinite, homogeneous reference medium, subjected to a uniform strain at infinity, while tractions are applied to the boundary of the SVE to ensure that the imposed strain at infinity coincides with the average strain over the SVE. The main asset of this new auxiliary problem resides in the fact that the associated Lippmann-Schwinger equation involves without approximation the Green operator for strains of the infinite body, which is translation-invariant and has very simple, closed-form expressions. Besides, an energy principle of the Hashin and Shtrikman type can be derived from this modified Lippmann-Schwinger equation, allowing for the computation of rigorous bounds on the apparent stiffness. The new auxiliary problem requires a cautious mathematical analysis, because it is formulated in an unbounded domain. Observing that the displacement is irrelevant for homogenization purposes, we show that selecting the strain as main unknown greatly eases this analysis. Finally, it is shown that the apparent stiffness defined through these new boundary conditions "interpolates" between the apparent stiffnesses defined through static and kinematic uniform boundary conditions, which casts a new light on these two types of boundary conditions. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Since its first medical application in 1973, the technique has improved dramatically in terms of acquisition times and resolution. The best resolution achievable for both parallel- and cone-beam setups is presently sub-micron. The macroscopic properties (stiffness, resistance, permeability, durability, \textbackslash ldots) of cementitious materials are known to be significantly affected by their multiscale microstructure. This calls for x-ray CT investigations of cementitious materials down to the smallest length-scales. The present review first provides background information on the technique (including image-processing). It then covers various applications of x-ray CT to cementitious materials: imaging of the porous network, durability experiments, damage experiments, \textbackslash ldots, cutting-edge nanotomography experiments. Current challenges such as time- and chemically-resolved experiments are also discussed.},

For homogenization purposes, we introduce an extension to stress-gradient materials of the principle of Hashin and Shtrikman. The variational principle is first stated within the framework of periodic homogenization, then extended to random homogenization. Contrary to the usual derivation of the classical principle, we adopt here a stress-based approach, much better suited to stress-gradient materials. We show that, in many cases of interest, the third-order trial eigenstrain may be discarded, leaving only one (second-order) trial eigenstrain in the functional to optimize. For N-phase materials, the bounds are very similar in structure to their classical counterpart. One notable difference is the fact that, even in the case of isotropy, the bounds depend on some additional microstructural parameters (besides the usual volume fractions).},

It is shown that microcracks will produce changes in the elastic constants of a material comparable with - but somewhat larger than - the change in electrical resistivity, rather than with change in density. Measurements have been made, both statically and dynamically, of Young's modulus, the shear modulus and Poisson's ratio for annealed and heavily cold-worked aluminium, copper and nickel. No changes in moduli were found that could be ascribed to the presence of microcracks. An unexpected result is a very large and consistent difference between the bulk moduli, and Poisson's ratio, determined statically and dynamically - a difference very much greater than can be accounted for by the usual thermodynamic relationship between isothermal and adiabatic moduli.},

A clear qualitative picture of the relative performance of the different models as a function of the loading direction is obtained by means of the incremental strain response envelopes. The definition of suitable error measures allows to obtain further quantitative information in this respect. For the particular initial conditions and loading programme considered in this study, the kinematic hardening and the enhanced K-hypoplastic models appear to provide the best performance overall.},

In this context, the thermal evolution of the basin plays an important role in the mechanical and chemo-mechanical deformation processes as heat modifies fluids viscosity and minerals physicochemical properties, thus affecting pore fluid expulsion and mineral stability. The present paper describes a three-dimensional constitutive and numerical model specifically devised for dealing with thermo-poromechanical deformation processes during diagenesis. The sedimentary basin is modeled as a fully saturated thermo-poro-elastoplastic-viscoplastic medium undergoing large strains. A key feature of the model is related to the evolution of the sediment material properties associated with temperature and large irreversible porosity changes. The computational model, which integrates both poroplastic and poroviscoplastic components of deformation at large strains, relies upon a parallel implementation of the finite element method with a shared memory multiprocessing interface. Numerical simulations of gravitational compaction during the sediment accretion phase as well as along geological period of pore pressure dissipation are performed in the context of oedometric setting. Special emphasis is given to temperature effects on the deformation history of the basin.},

  abstract = {The differentiation between obstructive and central respiratory events is one of the most recurrent tasks in the diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing. Esophageal pressure measurement is the gold-standard method to assess respiratory effort and identify these events. But as its invasiveness discourages its use in clinical routine, non-invasisve systems have been proposed for differentiation. However, their adoption has been slow due to their limited clinical validation, as the creation of manual, gold-standard validation sets by human experts is a cumbersome procedure. In this study, a new system is proposed for an objective automatic, gold-standard differentiation between obstructive and central hypopneas with the esophageal pressure signal. First, an overall of 356 hypopneas of 16 patients were manually scored by a human expert to create a gold-standard validation set. Then, features were extracted from each hypopnea to train and test classifiers (Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machines and adaboost classifiers) to differentiate between central and obstructive hypopneas with the gold-standard esophageal pressure signal. The automatic differentiation system achieved promising results, with a sensitivity of 0.88, a specificity of 0.93 and an accuracy of 0.90. Hence, this system seems promising for an automatic, gold-standard differentiation between obstructive and central hypopneas.},

  abstract = {Cosmetic products are generally formulated as emulsions, ointments, solutions or powders containing active ingredients. According to EU legislation, a cosmetic product is "any substance or preparation intended to be placed in contact with the various external parts of the human body with a view exclusively or mainly to cleaning, perfuming them, changing their appearance, and/or correcting body odors and/or protecting them or keeping them in good conditions". However, science advancement in both active carriers and ingredients has streamlined the process through which many cosmetic products by their delivery systems can induce modifications on the skin physiology. This is the reason why Reed and Kligman redefined these products as "cosmeceuticals", which refers to the combination of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Until recently, the term of cosmeceuticals has not had legal significance. The so-called cosmeceuticals, in fact, may induce modifications on the skin physiology, modifying, for example, transepidermal water loss, keratinocytes cohesion and turnover, modulating the inflammatory cascade, and/or altering the surface microbiota by the activity of the preservatives content. For these reasons, they are claimed to have medical or drug-like benefits. Naturally, their effectiveness on minor skin disorders or mild skin abnormalities has to be shown by in vitro and in vivo studies. On the other hand, their formulations contain emulsifiers, preservatives, and other chemicals which, by their cumulative use, may provoke side effects, such as allergic and/or sensitization phenomena. Moreover, many ingredients and packaging for such products are not biodegradable. In this study, we would like to introduce an innovative category of cosmeceuticals made by biodegradable nonwoven tissues. These cosmeceutical tissues, produced through the use of natural fibers, may bind different active ingredients and therefore become effective as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, sun-protective, whitening, or anti-aging products, depending on the ingredient(s) used. Differently from the usual cosmetics, they do not contain preservatives, emulsifiers, colors, and other chemicals. They can be applied as dried tissue on wet skin, remaining in loco for around 30 min, slowly releasing the active ingredients entrapped into the fibers. It is interesting to underline that the tissue, acting as a carrier, has its own effectiveness via chitin and lignin polymers with an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. When hydrolyzed by the human microbiota enzymes, they give rise to ingredients used as cell nourishment or energy. This paper will review part of the scientific research results, supporting this new category of biodegradable cosmetic products known as facial mask sheets.},

The intrinsic universality of percolation exponents is revealed by analyzing the power-law percolation relationship between two different scales (microstructure and macroscopic properties). In view that the classical percolation equation with fitting parameters lacks a clear correlation to the microstructure features, a physically based percolation model is proposed to characterize the effective electrical conductivity of particle filled composites by means of the combination of effective medium (EM) and percolation equations with universal exponents. It is shown that the present model agrees well with the experimental data. Furthermore, the effect of particle shape on the percolation threshold and the effect of electrical conductivity of particle on the effective properties of composites are discussed. \textcopyright 2006 SAGE Publications.},

Three pure bitumens, one polymer-modified-binder and two mixtures are chosen to validate the possible use of this methodology and apply it. Assumptions which are needed to apply this procedure, are verified on complex-modulus data measured from these materials. Hence, master-curves can be built without introducing error from manual adjustement. The method seems to be suitable for binders and mixtures as soon as their behaviour is in agreement with the time-temperature equivalency principle. In conclusion, some interpretations of the WLF constants are given.},

The vast number of the different molecules constituting bitumen is too complicated to unravel, thus in this paper we propose to fractionate bitumen into four fractions and study their different physico-chemical properties. The melting temperature and the glass transition of each fractions was determined by DSC while their molecular weight distribution was determined by HS-SEC. Finally, their rheological properties were investigated by DSR. This study highlighted the importance of all bitumen phases: the less polar liquid phase driving the viscous behavior up to -50 \textdegree C, the more polar solid phase responsible of the thermal stability and the stiffness, and finally the intermediate viscous oily phases allowing the molecular weight distribution continuity and by consequence allowing to have, on a large temperature range, a viscous liquid behavior at high temperature or low frequency, and an elastic stiff behavior at low temperature. Crystallizable fractions and asphaltene aggregates seemed to act as key molecular structures in the continuous phase.},

By means of the octet formalism recently established by the authors, an exact closed-form solution is obtained, for the first time, for coupled stretching and bending deformations of the plate subjected to remote uniform membrane stress resultants and bending moments. The stress resultants inside the elastic elliptic inhomogeneity are uniform, which is consistent with the uniformity property of the Eshelby inclusion solution in three-dimensional elasticity. In two special limit cases where the elliptic inhomogeneity becomes an elliptic rigid inclusion or hole, the corresponding solutions are also obtained. A relation between the rotational moment and the rotation is given for the elliptic rigid inclusion problem. The concentration factors of hoop membrane stress resultants and hoop bending moments are given for the elliptic hole problem. The intensity factors of membrane stress resultants and moments are obtained for a Griffith crack. Displacements, slopes, membrane stress resultants and bending moments along the elliptic boundary for the elliptic inhomogeneity, rigid inclusion and hole problems are all presented in a real form. \textcopyright 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

However, quality control of the recycled product is required during the manufacture process. This research deals with the use of high-content RAP recycled asphalt mixture composed of 70\% RAP based on experimental and micromechanical approaches. For the experimental part, a "Good" and a "Bad" blended mixture were manufactured in laboratory. Then, rheological measurements of the complex modulus of the different binders and mixtures were carried out. The micromechanical work is based on the generalised self-consistent scheme (GSCS) which was used to predict the mechanical properties of the recycled mixture. This approach aims to homogenize the heterogeneous material by taking into account both the intergranular porosity and the possible interactions between phases. The confrontation of the micromechanical model with the experimental results showed good agreements between measured data and predicted values of the complex modulus of the recycled asphalt. Moreover, it was highlighted from the experimental results that the blending process of the recycled mixture has a great influence on the viscoelastic properties of the recycled mixture. This result was also validated by the GSCS-based approach.},

  abstract = {Within the last decade, non-periodic homogenization proved to be an accurate upscaling method for computing smooth equivalent media of elastic models of the earth interior. Doing so, it reveals the seismic anisotropy induced by small-scale structures and it eases the numerical simulation of wave propagation in complex geological settings by preventing from the use of fine and complex meshes or grids, provided that wave simulators can take anisotropy into account. In the present work, we investigate the small-scale-induced anisotropy of a typical subsurface model, namely the SEG-EAGE overthrust, for a fmax = 10Hz wavefield. We find that the amount of anisotropy can reach 20\% locally and that orthorhombic anisotropy can be a poor approximation in some areas, suggesting that the analysis of datasets in terms of orthorhomby may be not relevant. However, while low-symmetry classes of anisotropy are naturally handled by the spectral-element method (SEM), they challenge the finite-difference method (FDM) in terms of implementation and computation cost. To estimate the benefit of using homogenized media in either SEM or FDM codes, we perform numerical simulations in both the initial overthrust model and its smooth version, using either regular SEM meshes or FDM grids of different resolution. We compare the obtained waveforms with a reference solution, which allows us to study the accuracy of the simulations as a function of the computation cost for both the SEM and the FDM.},

  abstract = {Permeability exerts significant control over the development of pore pressure excess in the crust, and it is a physical quantity sensitively dependent on the pore structure and stress state. In many applications, the relation between permeability and effective mean stress is assumed to be exponential and that between permeability and porosity is assumed to be a power law, so that the pressure sensitivity of permeability is characterized by the coefficient ? and the porosity sensitivity by the exponent a. In this study, we investigate experimentally the dependence of permeability on pressure and porosity in five sandstones with porosities ranging from 14\% to 35\% and we review published experimental data on intact rocks, unconsolidated materials and rock fractures. The laboratory data show that the pressure and porosity sensitivities differ significantly for different compaction mechanisms, but for a given compaction mechanism, the data can often be approximated by the empirical relations. The permeabilities of tight rocks and rock joints show relatively high pressure sensitivity and low porosity sensitivity. A wide range of values for a and ? have been observed in relation to the mechanical compaction of porous rocks, sand and fault gouge, whereas the porosity sensitivity for chemical compaction processes is often observed to be given by a\texttildelow 3. We show that since the ratio ?/a corresponds to the pore compressibility, the different dependences of permeability on porosity and pressure are related to the pore structure and its compressibility. Guided by the laboratory data, we conduct numerical simulations on the development of pore pressure in crustal tectonic settings according to the models ofWalder andNur (1984) andRice (1992). Laboratory data suggest that the pressure sensitivity of fault gouge is relatively low, and to maintain pore pressure at close to the lithostatic value in the Rice model, a relatively high influx of fluid from below the seismogenic layer is necessary. The fluid may be injected as vertically propagating pressure pulses into the seismogenic system, andRice's (1992) critical condition for the existence of solitary wave is shown to be equivalent to a{$>$}1, which is satisfied by most geologic materials in the laboratory. Laboratory data suggest that the porosity sensitivity is relatively high when the permeability is reduced by a coupled mechanical and chemical compaction process. This implies that in a crustal layer, pore pressure may be generated more efficiently than cases studied byWalder andNur (1984) who assumed a relatively low porosity sensitivity of a=2.},

  abstract = {We use asymptotic approximations for the elastic compliances (P, Q) of a spheroidal pore as input in the differential effective medium scheme to derive approximate analytical expressions for the effective moduli of an isotropic solid containing randomly oriented spheroids. The approximations are valid for crack-like pores having aspect ratios {$\alpha$} as high as 0.3, needle-like pores having aspect ratios as low as 3, and nearly spherical pores (0.7 {$<$} {$\alpha$} {$<$} 1.3). Analytical solutions for the differential scheme have previously only been available for the limiting cases of infinitely thin-cracks ({$\alpha$} = 0) and spherical pores ({$\alpha$} = 1). The relatively simple approximations found between the limiting cases can account for more realistic pore shapes, and are valid for a wide range of porosities. The behaviour of the effective Poisson's ratio in the high concentration limit shows that {$\nu$} is bounded between the Poisson's ratio of the solid and a fixed point {$\nu$}c that only depends on the aspect ratio of the pores. The asymptotic expressions for P and Q can also successfully be used as input in any other effective medium theory, such as the Mori-Tanaka or Kuster-Toksoz schemes. The relatively simple expressions found for the various effective medium schemes, as well as the bounds found for the effective Poisson's ratio, will be useful to simplify the process of inversion of elastic velocities in porous solids. \textcopyright 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Mathematically, 21 stiffnesses arranged in a 6 \texttimes{} 6 symmetric matrix completely describe the elastic properties of any homogeneous anisotropic medium, regardless of symmetry system and orientation. However, it can be difficult in practice to characterize an anisotropic medium's properties merely from casual inspection of its (often experimentally measured) stiffness matrix. For characterization purposes, it is better to decompose a measured stiffness matrix into a stiffness matrix for a canonically oriented transversely isotropic (TI) medium (whose properties can be readily understood) plus a generally anisotropic perturbation (representing the medium's deviation from perfect symmetry), followed by a rotation (giving the relationship between the medium's natural coordinate system and the measurement coordinate system). To accomplish this decomposition, we must find the rotated symmetric medium that best approximates a given stiffness matrix. An analytical formula exists for calculating the distance between the elastic properties of two anisotropic media. Starting from this formula, I show how to analytically calculate the TI medium with a [Formula: see text] symmetry axis that is nearest to a given set of 21 stiffness constants. There is no known analytical result if the symmetry axis is not fixed beforehand. I therefore present a simple search algorithm that scans all possible orientations of the nearest TI medium's symmetry axis. The grid is iteratively refined to optimize the solution. The algorithm is simple and robust and works well in practice, but it is not guaranteed to always find the optimal global answer if there are secondary minima that provide almost as good a fit as the optimal one.},

  abstract = {The present work provides an original consistent framework for combining different constitutive laws, possibly nonlinear, within diffuse interface models (phase field) by homogenization rather than by mixing the material parameters, such as to offer a greater flexibility. The framework relies on the choice of relevant thermodynamic potentials such that the homogenization schemes are natural choices in the thermodynamic formulation. Thus, it justifies previously proposed classic schemes (Ammar et al., 2009b) and gives clues to explore new schemes (Durga et al., 2013; Mosler et al., 2014) by defining relevant potentials. The proposed framework is illustrated by addressing two issues. First, Reuss and Voigt homogenization schemes are shown to deliver the same kinetics of diffusion-controlled transformations in the pure elastic case in the limit of vanishing diffuse interface width. Second, using the Voigt homogenization scheme, we demonstrate that the influence of viscoplasticity, either isotropic or crystalline, on diffusion-controlled transformations is non-trivial and cannot be inferred from simple qualitative arguments. Depending on the competition between the time scales of diffusion and viscoplasticity, the growth kinetics may exhibit intermediate behaviors between purely chemical and elastic cases. Moreover, it is shown how viscoplasticity can change the morphological stability of growing circular precipitates.},

  abstract = {This paper considers a saturated porous medium in which the matrix is a cracked solid. Progressive crack closure is responsible for an overall nonlinear poroelastic behavior. The state equations of nonlinear poroelasticity are derived in a differential form within a micromechanical framework. When a hydraulic connection exists between the cracks and the pores of the porous space, the tangent drained stiffness tensor as well as the tangent Biot tensor and modulus are shown to depend on Terzaghi effective stress. Estimates for these coefficients as functions of Terzaghi effective stress are then derived with the tools of homogenization for disordered media. They are based on a crack closure criterion giving the condition for a crack to be closed under a given macroscopic stress state, depending on its aspect ratio. In the case of an isotropic orientation of cracks, it is shown that the influence of cracks on the overall poroelastic properties is governed by the crack density parameter which characterizes the distribution of aspect ratios, Conversely, an experimental methodology for the determination of the distribution of aspect ratios from the measurement of the macroscopic compliance is proposed.},

  abstract = {In this work, a new micromechanical model to determine the effective elastic behavior of composite materials with ellipsoidal reinforcements and imperfect interfaces is developed. By using the Green's functions technique, the integral equation of the linear elastic medium is reformulated in the presence of imperfect interfaces. The integral equation is then solved in the case of an ellipsoidal inclusion embedded in an infinite matrix with imperfect interface. By introducing the concept of interior and exterior-point Eshelby tensors, the solution of the inclusion problem is obtained in the case of displacement discontinuities and continuous traction across the interface between inclusion and matrix. The concentration equations are then exactly expressed in the general case of anisotropic elastic behavior and ellipsoidal inclusions with imperfect interface. In the case of spring interface model, the explicit concentration equations are obtained. In the case of isotropic elasticity, we retrieved the analytical strain concentration tensors from the literature for spherical inclusion morphology. The Mori-Tanaka homogenization scheme is used to determine the local strain and stress fields in each phase and effective elastic moduli of composite materials. In the case of fibrous composites under plane strain loading, the effective elastic moduli are successfully compared to those obtained by complex variable methods. The combined influence of shape of inclusions and interface parameters is analyzed on the effective elastic behavior.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers. This paper presents a new approach to model the creep behavior of cement paste at early ages. The creep behavior is simulated by applying a time-varying generalized Maxwell model on the individual elements of a finite-element mesh of a simulated three-dimensional microstructure and compared with results in the literature. All mechanical properties of the constituent phases are taken from literature and Maxwell chain parameters are obtained by fitting the intrinsic creep of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H). A reasonable agreement between the simulations and the experimental results are obtained by assuming a constant C-S-H density of 2.0 g/cm 3 . It was found that better agreements could be obtained at low degree of hydrations, by assuming a loosely packed C-S-H growing in the microstructure. It was also found that the short-term creep characteristics of C-S-H from nanoindentation can be used to reproduce macroscopic creep at least over a few days. The results show how numerical models can be used to upscale phase characteristics to macroscopic properties of composites.},

The main part of the study is devoted to the derivation of exact solutions for mechanical fields (damage distribution, displacement, stress fields) in a hollow sphere subjected to a radial loading and made up of an elastic damageable material. The solutions, discussed in link with the different homogenization schemes, may serve as a reference for assessment of numerical predictions of brittle damage models. Interestingly, it is shown that the existence of physically meaningful solutions strongly depends on the model under consideration. Finally, we establish explicit solution to the hollow sphere problem in unloading regime.},

  abstract = {A scheme is proposed for predicting the effective conductivities of heterogeneous media containing ellipsoidal inclusions of diverse shapes, spatial distributions, and orientations. This scheme yields explicit expressions for the effective conductivity tensor in terms of three microstructural parameters that characterize the shape, distribution, and orientation of the inclusions. By expanding the effective conductivity tensor in terms of the volume fraction of the inclusions, it is found that the effect of the shape of the distribution ellipsoid on the effective conductivity tensor is of a higher order in the volume fraction than the effect of the shape of the inclusions. The scheme proposed here generalizes the Maxwell formula to heterogeneous media containing multiple inclusions while also taking into account the orientation of the inclusions. Thus, the existing formulas in the literature are special cases of the general formulas given by the present scheme. The predicted effective conductivities of heterogeneous media containing aligned ellipsoidal inclusions, randomly oriented ellipsoidal inclusions, spheroidal inclusions with orientational distributions, and mixtures of cavities and cracks are found to agree well with the experimental results and the results of other schemes.},

  abstract = {The description of the mechanical behavior of bitumen on the basis of its microstructure allows its improvement and moreover the development of equivalent or even more sustainable materials with similar properties. For this reasons, a micromechanical model for bitumen is proposed, allowing the description of the viscoelastic bitumen behavior depending on characteristics of different material phases. The definition and demarcation, respectively, of material phases is based on SARA fractions, and polarity considerations that support the assumption of asphaltene micelle structures within a contiguous matrix and the assumed interactions between them. A sufficient number of static creep tests on artificially composed bitumen samples with asphaltene contents from 0 to 30 wt\% served both as identification as well as validation experiments for the developed micromechanical model. An excellent agreement between experimental results and model predictions indicates that the model is able to reproduce significant microstructural effects, such as interactions between asphaltenes, which strongly influence the bitumen behavior. This model is therefore expected to contribute to a better understanding of the influence of the bitumen microstructure on the macroscopic mechanical behavior and subsequently be able to describe the mechanical consequences of microstructural effects like aging.},

  abstract = {This research deals with an experimental and micromechanical study of high rate recycled asphalt with 70\% of RAP. Rheological measurements of shear complex modulus of virgin, RAP and blended binders were performed at different temperatures and frequencies. Then, a micromechanical model based on the generalized self-consistent scheme (GSCS) was suggested for the prediction of the effective mechanical properties of the recycled asphalt. The GSCS-based approach aims to homogenize the heterogeneous material taking into account the intergranular porosity, on the one hand, and the possible interactions between its phases on the other one. The suggested method was compared to a step-by-step (successive) homogenization approach and literature data in elastic case were used for this purpose. The results have shown that the GSCS-based approach presents a good agreement with the data especially for higher volume fractions of aggregates. Furthermore, the significant influence of the blend homogeneity level on the estimation of the effective mechanical properties of the recycled asphalt was highlighted.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a poromechanical model for drying of unsaturated porous media valid for a large range of relative humidity. Using the proper laws of thermodynamics, this model is derived and permits to account for different effects that contribute to the effective stress development: the average pore pressure effect, the energy of the interfaces effect, the surface adsorption effect and the Shuttleworth effect. The majority of the input parameters of this model are simply assessed by using two commonly known techniques for the characterization of pores structures applied on experimental desorption isotherms: the B.E.T theory (Brunauer et al., 1938) and the BJH technique (Barrett et al., 1951). Another input parameter (linked to the Shuttleworth effect) is fitted on experimental drying shrinkage strains. This model is tested and validated with experimental data for different porous materials - hardened ordinary cement paste, high- performance concrete and Vycor glass - found in the literature. The obtained results show a satisfactory evaluation of the drying shrinkage strains for all three tested materials, with the possibility of considering zero fitting parameter. Compared to other poromechanical models found in the literature such as the classical Biot-Bishop (Biot, 1941) model and the (Coussy et al., 2003) model, our model appears to be capable of displaying the transition at a certain relative humidity between the capillary pressure effects and the surface adsorption effect, which manifests itself by a plateau in the drying shrinkage strains curve at this value of relative humidity.},

  abstract = {It is supposed that a region within an isotropic elastic solid undergoes a spontaneous change of form which, if the surrounding material were absent, would be some prescribed homogeneous deformation. Because of the presence of the surrounding material stresses will be present both inside and outside the region. The resulting elastic field may be found very simply with the help of a sequence of imaginary cutting, straining and welding operations. In particular, if the region is an ellipsoid the strain inside it is uniform and may be expressed in terms of tabu\-lated elliptic integrals. In this case a further problem may be solved. An ellipsoidal region in an infinite medium has elastic constants different from those of the rest of the material; how does the presence of this inhomogeneity disturb an applied stress-field uniform at large distances? It is shown that to answer several questions of physical or engineering interest it is necessary to know only the relatively simple elastic field inside the ellipsoid.},

  abstract = {Chloride penetration in concrete can lead to steel corrosion which is one of the major pathologies affecting reinforced concrete's durability. The development of methods to investigate chloride penetration is essential to predict and update the service life of the structure. A non-destructive (ND) DC-electrical technique is used in this study: this Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) device is arranged in a Wenner configuration and measures apparent resistivities. Apparent resistivities are then inverted in order to obtain a resistivity profile versus depth. In parallel, a calibration method relating the resistivity to the chloride content for each type of concrete is used to obtain the chloride profile versus depth. This methodology was applied to a chloride diffusion experimental program on two concrete formulations and one mortar. The profiles evaluated by NDT are then compared to those obtained by a destructive method (potentiometric titration). Both types of profile fit relatively well, thus, the presented methodology is validated for determining chloride content profiles by means of a non-destructive ERT device. The evaluation of the uncertainty range of successive processes (measurement, inversion and calibration) underlines the importance on including the uncertainties in the interpretation of the ND profiles in future research.},

Compared with standard discrete methods for frictional contacts, the phase-field method has two attractive features: (i) it can represent arbitrary crack geometry without an explicit function or basis enrichment, and (ii) it does not require an algorithm for imposing contact constraints. The first feature, which is common in phase-field models of fracture, is attained by regularizing a sharp interface geometry using a surface density functional. The second feature, which is a unique advantage for contact problems, is achieved by a new approach that calculates the stress tensor in the regularized interface region depending on the contact condition of the interface. Particularly, under a slip condition, this approach updates stress components in the slip direction using a standard contact constitutive law, while making other stress components compatible with stress in the bulk region to ensure nonpenetrating deformation in other directions. We verify the proposed phase-field method using stationary interface problems simulated by discrete methods in the literature. Subsequently, by allowing the phase field to evolve according to brittle fracture theory, we demonstrate the proposed method's capability for modeling crack growth with frictional contact.},

We deal here with the case where the symmetry is a priori unknown, as for biological or geological materials, or when the process makes the material symmetry axis uncertain (some composites, monocrystals). The measurements are then more complicated and the raw stiffness tensor obtained does not exhibit any symmetry in the Voigt's matrical form, as it is expressed in the arbitrarily chosen specimen's base. A complete ultrasonic measurement of this stiffness tensor from redundant measurements is proposed. In a second time, we show how to make a plane symmetry pole figure able to give visual information about the quasi-symmetries of a raw stiffness tensor determined by any measurement method. Finally we introduce the concept of distance from a raw stiffness tensor to one of the eight symmetry classes available for a stiffness tensor. The method provides the nearest tensor (to the raw stiffness tensor) possessing a chosen symmetry class, with its associated natural symmetry base. \textcopyright{} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Axisymmetrical needle orientation requires derivation of the Hill tensor for arbitrarily oriented ellipsoidal inclusions with one axis tending towards infinity, embedded in a transversely isotropic matrix; therefore, Laws' integral expression of the Hill tensor is evaluated employing the theory of rational functions. For a porosity lower 0.4, the elastic properties of the polycrystal with uniformly oriented needles are quasi-identical to those of a polycrystal with solid spheres. However, as opposed to the sphere-based model, the needle-based model does not predict a percolation threshold. As regards axisymmetrical orientation distribution of needles, two effects are remarkable: Firstly, the sharper the cone of orientations the higher the anisotropy of the polycrystal. Secondly, for a given cone, the anisotropy increases with the porosity. Estimates for the polycrystal stiffness are hardly influenced by the anisotropy of the bone mineral needles. Our results also confirm the very high degree of orientation randomness of crystals building up mineral foams in bone tissues. ?? 2006 Acad??mie des sciences. Published by Elsevier SAS.

  abstract = {The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cement hydration model starts with a three-dimensional digital image of cement particles, and then uses cellular automaton rules to simulate the reaction of cement with water and the development of cement paste microstructure. This stochastic model uses a digital image with a certain resolution to represent the reality of continuum shapes in a fairly small periodic unit cell. As such, it is potentially subject to statistical fluctuation, finite size error, and the effects of digital resolution. This paper evaluates the model in light of these potential sources of error, along with the effects of cement particle size istribution (PSD), water/cement (w/c) ratio, and cement chemistry, by focusing on the phase percolation and transport property predictions of the model. Statistical fluctuation and finite size error are shown to be of minor importance in the model. The deffect of digital resolution is significant, however, but different from the case of a finite element or finite difference model. Unlike these cases, the "best" resolution is not necessarily the finest resolution, but must be chosen based on comparison with experiment and various physical length scales present in cement paste. \textcopyright 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {FFT-based methods are used to solve the problem of a heterogeneous unit-cell submitted to periodic boundary conditions, which is of a great interest in the context of numerical homogenization. Recently (in 2010), Brisard and Zeman proposed simultaneously to use Conjugate Gradient based solvers in order to improve the convergence properties (when compared to the basic scheme, proposed initially in 1994). The purpose of the paper is to extend this idea to the case of non-linear behaviors. The proposed method is based on a Newton-Raphson algorithm and can be applied to various kinds of behaviors (time dependant or independent, with or without internal variables) through a conventional integration procedure as used in finite element codes. It must be pointed out that this approach is fundamentally different from the traditional FFT-based approaches which rely on a fixed-point algorithm (e.g. basic scheme, Eyre and Milton accelerated scheme, Augmented Lagrangian scheme, etc.). The method is compared to the basic scheme on the basis of a simple application (a linear elastic spherical inclusion within a non-linear elastic matrix): a low sensitivity to the reference material and an improved efficiency, for a soft or a stiff inclusion, are observed. At first proposed for a prescribed macroscopic strain, the method is then extended to mixed loadings. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Test results show that a pore pressure increase and a confining pressure decrease both result in an increase of the permeability, and that the effect of the pore pressure change on the variation of the permeability is more important than the effect of a change of the confining pressure. A power law is proposed for the variation of the permeability with the effective stress ({$\sigma{'}$}={$\sigma$}\textendash nkpf). The permeability-effective stress coefficient nk increases linearly with the differential pressure and is greater than unity as soon as the differential pressure exceeds few bars. The test results are well reproduced using the proposed permeability-effective stress law. A conceptual pore-shell model based on a detailed observation of the microstructure of the studied limestone is proposed. This model is able to explain the experimental observations on the effect of the total stress and of the pore pressure on the permeability of the limestone. Effective stress coefficients for the stress-dependent permeability which are greater than one are obtained. It is shown that the controlling factor is the ratio of the different bulk moduli of the various constituents of the rock. This ratio is studied experimentally by performing microhardness tests.},

This estimator is derived from the exact effective stiffness of a generic monofiller composite associated with Eshelby's equivalence principle. It is originally developed for a two-phase ellipsoidal configuration and is subsequently generalized to multiphase heterogeneities via a layer-wise sweeping procedure. The developed estimator has an explicit form, which makes it amenable to computer programming. The performance of the proposed estimator is evaluated by analyzing several numerical examples of spherical compounds and two spheroidal ones spanning a wide range of elasticity contrasts, which are also examined by two other applicable Eshelby-type estimators. To assess the validity of our estimator in two-level homogenization problems, several examples of composite systems reinforced with core-shell inclusions are analyzed using a two-level homogenization scheme in which use is made of the estimator of this study. It is concluded that the presented estimator can be applied to a wide range of multiphase ellipsoidal heterogeneities or limit cases thereof, as well as heterogeneities with radially graded interphases.},

  abstract = {In this work we analyze the problem of finding the electric behavior of an anisotropic ellipsoid (arbitrarily shaped) placed in a dielectric anisotropic environment. We suppose that the whole system is exposed to a uniform electric field remotely applied. In order to find the resulting electric quantities inside the particle and outside it we adopt a technique largely utilized for solving similar problems in elasticity theory. The inhomogeneity problems in elastostatics are solved within the framework of the Eshelby theory, which adopts, as crucial points, the concepts of eigenstrains and inclusions. The generalization and assessment of such an approach for the dielectric inhomogeneity problems is here addressed by means of the introduction of the concepts of eigenfields and inclusions in electrostatics. The advantages of this methodology are mainly two: firstly, we can consider completely arbitrary dielectric anisotropic behavior both for the particle and the host matrix. Secondly, we easily find explicit expressions for the electric quantities both inside and outside the inhomogeneity. The problem under consideration was solved in earlier literature by analyzing the singularity of the dyadic Green function, expressed as a two-dimensional integral. Here we propose a reformulation described by a one-dimensional integral obtained from explicitly electrostatic analysis, which can have both pedagogical and computational importance. We also introduce a method to generalize these results to the case of an arbitrary nonlinear anisotropic ellipsoid embedded in a linear anisotropic matrix. Finally, we show some applications to the dielectric characterization of anisotropic composite materials.},

The particles are considered randomly oriented and positioned within the matrix. Moreover, all constitutive equations (matrix, cores, shells) exhibit an hereditary behavior, leading to an arbitrary temporal dispersion. While matrix and shell are considered linear, the particles core shows an additional third-order nonlinearity. We develop an effective medium theory, which allows us to calculate the linear and nonlinear response in terms of the microstructure features. In particular, we can investigate the effects of the inter-phase on the overall behavior, in combination with the randomness of the orientations and with the linear and nonlinear hereditary phenomena. The results may find relevant applications in material science and, more specifically, in nonlinear optics, bulk plasmonics and metamaterials.},

  abstract = {Interfacial continuity and discontinuity relations are needed in dealing with a variety of mechanical and physical phenomena in heterogeneous media. The present work consists of two parts. In the first part concerned with perfect interfaces, two orthogonal projection operators reflecting the interfacial continuity and discontinuity of the field variables of coupled mechanical and physical phenomena are introduced and some coordinate-free interfacial relations involving the surface decomposition of a generic linear constitutive law are deduced. In the second part dedicated to the derivation of a general imperfect interface model for coupled multifield phenomena by applying Taylor's expansion to a 3D curved thin interphase perfectly bonded to its two neighboring phases, the interfacial operators and relations given in the first part are used directly so as to render the derivation more direct and to write the final interfacial jump relations characterizing the model in a unified and compact way. The general imperfect interface model obtained in the present work includes as special cases all the relevant ones reported in the literature. \textcopyright 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In particular, we obtained that the error of such an approximation is less than 20\% if the extent of anisotropy is moderate - the ratio of Young's moduli in transverse and in-plane directions is less than 1.87.

To improve the reverse conversion from permittivity measurements to moisture content, we suggest the building of an electromagnetic model of concrete. In this paper, such a model is developed for the case of cement pastes. It relies on electromagnetic homogenization schemes which require an information about the permittivity of the predominant species in the material. Estimating those properties over the frequency range [200 MHz; 1 GHz] was achieved by synthesizing model cementitious binders (C-S-H and portlandite mixtures), by characterizing their macroscopic permittivity with an open-ended coaxial probe and by identifying their intrinsic permittivity with a specific homogenization procedure combining effective medium equations. The identified values are used as inputs for a homogenization procedure estimating the water content in cement pastes. For a wide range of water content, the simulated and measured real parts of permittivity show a good agreement.},

Herein, we aim at shedding some light on the issue, by developing and verifying three different continuum-micromechanics representations of the collagen-mineral interaction in the elasticity of mineralized tissues: (i) mineral foam matrix with collagen inclusions, (ii) interpenetrating network of hydroxyapaptite crystals and collagen molecules, (iii) composite of fibrils (collagen-hydroxyapatite network) embedded in a collagen-free extrafibrillar mineral foam matrix. The validation of the different concepts, based on independent sets of experiments, shows remarkable predictive capabilites of the different micromechanical representations. Still, there are significant differences in the performance of these three different micromechanical concepts, related to the sophistication with which the ultrastructure of bone is modelled. Consideration of the fibrillar organization of bone ultrastructure improves over simpler concepts like an interpenetrating network of mineral crystals and collagen molecules, which in turn is superior to a crystal-foam representation with collagen inclusions. In fact, the most advanced concept treated here integrates the two others to a consistent whole: Each fibril is regarded as an interpenetrating network of collagen molecules and mineral crystals. The fibrils host the minority of the mineral crystals present in the tissues. At a higher observation scale, the fibrils function as templates or reinforcement in an extrafibrillar crystal foam-type matrix, which hosts the majority of the minerals present in the bone ultrastructure. The reinforcement function corresponds to low-mineralized tissues (such as deer antler) where the extrafibrillar mineral foam is softer than the fibrils, whereas the template function corresponds to high-mineralized tissues (such as cow tibia) where the extrafibrillar mineral foam is stiffer than the fibrils. The collagen is clearly represented as the governing element in inducing the anisotropy of the tissues, by (i) the anisotropy of molecular collagen itself, (ii) the anisotropy of the fibrils, and (iii) the oriented morphology of the cylindrical fibrils in the isotropic extrafibrillar space. \textcopyright 2004 Elsevier SAS.

It often provides technical and economic advantages versus conventional repair methods for numerous boundary conditions. Hence, the application of CP is recently considered for repair measures with complicated arrangements of reinforcement or geometries. In these cases, the common design guidelines and criteria for CP applications may fail or lead to erroneous results. The numerical prediction of the current and potential distribution within the structure can then be used for design purposes. The modeling procedure for CP differs from those for galvanic corrosion by existence of an additional CP anode system. Especially in Impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) systems the discretization of the CP anode has a significant impact on the modeling procedure and its results. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed and compared to existing approaches for relevant parameters including concrete resistivities by means of parametrical studies.},

It has been subject to numerous research projects and has proven its capabilities in countless repair measures around the world. Nevertheless, due to the uniqueness of each application as well as the large number of influencing factors (e.g., geometry, concrete resistivity distribution, kinetics of rebar, and CP anode system) the design and operation of CP systems is still governed by the use of (semi-) empirical calculations and criteria. Within this study, numerical simulation has been used to determine the current and potential distribution during the application of CP. On the basis of this data, which are not measurable on site, the significance of the most important criterion for the operation of CP systems, the so called 100 mV decay criterion, shall be discussed. In particular, the correlation of the criterion with the corrosion state of the active reinforcement against a backdrop of time dependent effects of CP is within the scope of this study.},

  abstract = {Although viscoelastic moduli may be linear, Poisson ratios (PR) are always nonlinear functions of pairs of normal strains. This is equally true for physical PR defined in the real time space and for pseudo PR differently derived in the Fourier transform (FT) domain. It is shown analytically that only if anisotropic or isotropic viscoelastic moduli and relaxation or creep functions are characterized by identical time functions in all ditections and stresses are constants or at most temporal and spatial separable functions, then corresponding PR must be time independent. Under all other conditions PR are proven to be time, stress and thermal expansion dependent through time integrals, although physical and pseudo PR are shown to be functionally unrelated. The consequences of PR nonlinearities are that their uniaxially determined values are not applicable to other uniaxial loadings with different time histories or to multiaxial loadings and thermal expansions, if the latter are present. Similarly, isotropic PR cannot generally be determined solely from viscoelastic Young's and shear moduli, even for linear materials. Consequently, viscoelastic material property characterization in terms of PR is not unique and viscoelastic responses are best described in terms of creep or relaxation functions. Anisotropic and isotropic viscoelastic PR time effects are investigated analytically and evaluated numerically.}

The elasticity of the inclusion, its heterogeneity, and that of the infinite domain may be distinct and arbitrary. The ellipsoidal heterogeneity may include other inclusions, or it may have variable elasticity. Average field quantities for the double inclusion are estimated analytically with the aid of a theorem which generalizes the Tanaka-Mori observation (1972; J. Elast. 2, 199-200). It is shown that the averaging scheme based on the double-inclusion model produces the overall moduli of two-phase composites with greater flexibility and hence effectiveness than the self-consistent and the Mori-Tanaka (1973; Acta Metall. 21, 571-574) methods, and, indeed, includes as special cases these methods, providing alternative interpretations for them. The double-inclusion model is then generalized to multi-inclusion models where, again, all the average field quantities are estimated analytically. As examples of the application of the multi-inclusion model, a composite containing inclusions with multilayer coatings and a composite consisting of several distinct materials are considered, and their overall moduli are analytically estimated. In addition, for a set of nested ellipsoidal regions of arbitrary aspect ratios and relative locations, which is embedded in an infinitely extended homogeneous elastic solid of arbitrary elasticity, and which undergoes transformations with uniform but distinct transformation strains within each annulus, it is shown that the resulting strain field averaged over each annulus can be computed exactly and in closed form; the transformation strains in the innermost region need not be uniform. Explicit results are presented for an embedded double inclusion, as well as a nested set of n inclusions. \textcopyright 1993.},

  abstract = {The equivalent elastic properties of a fractured medium is currently approached by various effective medium theories or numerical modelling of seismic wave propagation. However, these methods are limited by computational considerations and scale separation. This study proposes to extend the use of the non-periodic homogenization to fractured media. This method enables to go beyond size restriction and opens the path to the effective properties of multi-scale fractured media. First, the non-periodic homogenization is challenged towards well-established effective medium theories in the framework of the Eshelby problem. Elliptical fractures embedded in a 2D medium are depicted and the effective stiffness tensor obtained by the homogenization is compared to solutions predicted by effective medium theories. The non-periodic homogenization is best described by the differential scheme in the case of flat fractures whereas the NIA approximation is preferred for ellipses with an aspect ratio greater than 0.1. In a second part, the variation of the stiffness matrix induced by a fracture orientation deviation is quantified and set up against the effects of the fracture length and the aspect ratio.},

  abstract = {Customary micromechanics models for the poroelasticity, creep, and strength of concrete restrict the domain affected by the hydration reaction to the cement paste volume, considering the latter as a thermodynamically closed system with respect to the (chemically inert) aggregate. Accordingly, the famous Powers hydration model appears to be a natural choice for the determination of clinker, cement, water, and aggregate volume fractions entering such micromechanical models. The situation changes once internal curing occurs, i.e., once part of the water present is absorbed initially by the aggregate, and then is sucked back to the cement paste during the hydration reaction. This paper develops an extended hydration model for this case, introducing water uptake capacity of the aggregate and paste void-filling extent as additional quantities. Based on constant values for just these two new quantities, and on previously determined creep properties of cement pastes as functions of an effective water:cement mass ratio (i.e., that associated with the cement paste domain rather than with the entire concrete volume), a series of ultrashort-term creep tests on different mortars and concretes can be very satisfactorily predicted by a standard microviscoelastic mathematical model. This further extends the applicability range of micromechanics modeling in cement and concrete research.},

In this work we discuss FFT-based homogenization for elastic problems at large deformations, with a focus on the following improvements. Firstly, we exhibit the fixed point method introduced by Moulinec and Suquet for small deformations as a gradient descent method. Secondly, we propose a Newton\textendash Krylov method for large deformations. We give an example for which this methods needs approximately 20 times less iterations than Newton's method using linear fixed point solvers and roughly 100 times less iterations than the nonlinear fixed point method. However, the Newton\textendash Krylov method requires 4 times more storage than the nonlinear fixed point scheme. Exploiting the special structure we introduce a memory-efficient version with 40 \% memory saving. Thirdly, we give an analytical solution for the micromechanical solution field of a two-phase isotropic St.Venant\textendash Kirchhoff laminate. We use this solution for comparison and validation, but it is of independent interest. As an example for a microstructure relevant in engineering we discuss finally the application of the FFT-based method to glass fiber reinforced polymer structures.},

Various approaches to the problem are discussed; they are further assessed by comparing their predictions to results for sample deterministic arrays. These computer experiments indicate that the approximation of non-interacting cracks has a wider than expected range of applicability. Some of the deficiencies of various approximate schemes seem to be related to inadequacy of the conventionally used crack density parameter (insensitive to mutual positions of cracks). An alternative parameter that has this sensitivity, is suggested. Finally, the problem of effective moduli is discussed in the context of ``damage mechanics''. It is argued that, contrary to the spirit of many damage models, there is no direct quantitative correlation between progression of a microcracking solid towards fracture and deterioration of its stiffness; thus, the effective moduli may not always serve as a reliable indicator of damage.},

A number of mathematical aspects that frequently constitute fields of their own (like various numerical techniques) are discussed very briefly in the chapter. The focus is on physically important effects produced by crack interactions and to present results in the simplest form possible. The problems considered in this chapter can be divided into two groups: (1) The impact of interactions on individual cracks, particularly on the stress intensity factors (SIFs), and (2) the effective elastic properties of solids with many cracks. Problems of the first group are, generally, relevant for the fracture-related considerations; solutions are sensitive to the positions of individual cracks. Problems of the second group deal with the volume average quantities; they are relatively insensitive to the information on individual cracks. The chapter discusses, in this connection, whether correlations exist between these two groups of quantities; in particular, whether microcracking can be reliably monitored by measuring changes in the effective elastic moduli. \textcopyright 1994, Academic Press Inc.},

  abstract = {Effective elastic properties of solids with cavities of various shapes are derived in two approximations: the approximation of non-interacting cavities and the approximation of the average stress field (Mori-Tanaka's scheme); the latter appears to be appropriate when mutual positions of defects are random. We construct the elastic potential of a solid with cavities. Such an approach covers, in a unified way, cavities of various shapes and any mixture of them. No degeneracies (or a need in a special limiting procedure) arise when cavities shrink to cracks. It also provides a unified description of both isotropic and anisotropic effective properties and recovers results available in the literature for special cases. Elastic potentials dictate the choice of proper parameters of cavity density. These parameters depend on defect shapes. Even in the case of random orientations, the isotropic overall properties cannot be characterized in terms of porosity alone; for elliptical holes, for example, a second parameter - ``eccentricity'' - is needed.},

  abstract = {Corrosion of rebar within reinforced concrete is a major problem for countries where salt is applied to roads for deicing. Concrete structures are periodically inspected in order to monitor possible damage caused by chloride-induced corrosion of the reinforce- ment. However, the available drilling and visual inspections do not supply sufficient spatial information or can only be assessed in advanced stages of corrosion, respectively. Conse- quently, the condition of bridge decks can only be assessed with low certainty. Therefore, a spatially continuous and non-destructive method detecting chloride in concrete structures is desirable. This Ph.D. thesis deals with the non-destructive monitoring of chloride ion con- centration inside the concrete of bridge decks, in the case of seasonal exposition to chlo- rides. Novel Ground Penetrating Radar data processing methodologies and their prerequi- sites are presented. An experiment recreating chloride contamination processes in concrete was designed. From it, a Ground Penetrating Radar dataset was acquired. The dataset was processed with these novel methodologies. The results analysis enabled the constitution of empiric relationships linking concrete condition and Ground Penetrating Radar datasets.},

A self-consistent effective field method allows reducing this problem to the problem for a typical cell of the composite that contains a finite number of the inclusions. The volume integral equations for strain and stress fields in a heterogeneous medium are used. Discretization of these equations is performed by the radial Gaussian functions centered at a system of approximating nodes. Such functions allow calculating the elements of the matrix of the discretized problem in explicit analytical form. For a regular grid of approximating nodes, the matrix of the discretized problem has the Toeplitz properties, and matrix-vector products with such matrices may be calculated by the fast fourier transform technique. The latter accelerates significantly the iterative procedure. First, the method is applied to the calculation of elastic fields in a homogeneous medium with a spherical heterogeneous inclusion and then, to composites with periodic and random sets of spherical inclusions. Simple cubic and FCC lattices of the inclusions which material is stiffer or softer than the material of the matrix are considered. The calculations are performed for cells that contain various numbers of the inclusions, and the predicted effective constants of the composites are compared with the numerical solutions of other authors. Finally, a composite material with a random set of spherical inclusions is considered. It is shown that the consideration of a composite cell that contains a dozen of randomly distributed inclusions allows predicting the composite effective elastic constants with sufficient accuracy.. \textcopyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The case of hybrid composites with two different families of ellipsoidal inclusion is also considered.

  abstract = {Two mathematical approaches have been compared for modeling the electrical behavior (e.g., electric/current density field) of an electrolyte. The first approach uses the traditional Ohmic method (Laplace equation) based on the assumption of a uniform concentration of ions in the electrolyte. The second approach utilizes the ionic transport method that takes into account the effect of electrochemical transport/reaction of ions assuming a quasi-electro neutral bulk for the electrolyte. For the latter, the Poisson\textendash Nernst\textendash Planck (PNP) equations are employed to include impacts of the non-uniformity of the concentration of ions on the electrical pattern of the electrolyte. Demonstratively, a 2D case was studied. It comprises two unequally sized electrodes, which are separated by the electrolyte. Findings show that the electrical behavior of the electrolyte remains unchanged using an Ohmic approach, regardless of variations in operational parameters such as applied voltage and electrode polarity. In contrast, the electrical behavior in response to the operational parameters is found to be significantly influenced using the ionic transport approach. Therefore, Ohm's law is invalid in the bulk of an electrolyte, when a non-uniform concentration field of ions exists. Ultimately, the obtained results helped to propose an explanation on a commonly observed phenomenon (melt rate-polarity relationship) during the DC operation of the electroslag remelting (ESR) process.},

The XCT images directly show three-dimensional (3D) pore structure, along with cracks. Qualitative visualization is useful; however, quantitative results depend on accurately segmenting the XCT images. Methods of segmentation and image analysis were carefully developed based, as much as possible, on aspects of the images themselves. These enabled quantitative measures of porosity, including how porosity varies in and across the build direction, pore size distribution, how pore structure varies between parts with similar porosity levels but different processing parameters, pore shape, and particle size distribution of un-melted powder trapped in pores. These methods could possibly serve as the basis for standard segmentation and image analysis methods for metallic additively manufactured parts, enabling accurate and reliable defect detection and quantitative measures of pore structure, which are critical aspects of qualification and certification.},

In regime II, C-S-H starts to include gel porosity. The forming gel densifies linearly with decreasing precipitation space. Thereby, regime III starts once the C-S-H gel has completely filled the capillary porosity. These findings allow for developing an analytical hydration model. It provides expressions for C-S-H gel densification and for the evolution of the volume fractions of clinker, of solid hydrates, as well as of the gel and capillary porosities, as functions of the water-to-cement ratio and the hydration degree; consistently representing published experimental data.},

This novel scheme, resting largely on Dvorak's transformation field analysis coupled with eigenstressed matrix-inhomogeneity problems of the Eshelby-Laws type, is sophisticated enough to translate, in a very precise fashion, both the molecular mechanics-proven elasticity of solid C-S-H and the precipitation space-driven evolution of gel porosity within shape-changing hydrate gel phases, into the elastic and poro-elastic properties of cement paste.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the results of a European benchmark on multiscale creep modeling for cementitious materials, performed in the framework of the COST Action TU1404 ``Towards the next generation of standards for service life of cement-based materials and structures''. Three micromechanical models from three research groups have been adopted for modeling the basic non-aging creep of cementitious materials. The benchmark is based on the hypotheses that creep results only from calcium-silicate-hydrates (C-S-H) and that viscoelastic behavior of all microstructural constituents is maturity- and composition-independent. By comparing model results among themselves as well as by comparing model predictions with experimental results obtained from three different laboratories, we demonstrate that creep upscaling from micrometer-sized C-S-H to centimeter-sized macroscopic samples of cement paste, mortar, and concrete, and from minutes-long creep tests at early ages to days-long creep tests at very mature ages is indeed possible. The benchmark also highlights the importance of considering micro-anisotropy of C-S-H in terms of non-spherical shapes for C-S-H hydrates.},

First, micromechanical mean-field estimates of elastic moduli for selected metal matrix composite systems are compared with the results of finite element calculations performed for two simplified unit cells: spherical and cylindrical. Advantages and deficiencies of such numerical verification of analytical homogenization schemes are indicated. Next, predictions of both approaches are compared with available experimental data for two composite systems for tension and compression tests in the elastic-plastic regime using tangent and secant linearization procedures. In the examined range of strain and ceramic volume content, both the Mori-Tanaka averaging scheme and the generalized self-consistent scheme lead to reliable predictions when combined with the tangent linearization, while the use of secant moduli results in a too stiff response. It is also found that the mean-field predictions for a small ceramic volume content are very close to the results obtained from the finite-element analysis of a spherical unit cell.},

The essence of the method used is the representation of the displacement field in a multiply-connected domain as a sum of general solutions for corresponding single-connected domains. Each term of this sum, in turn, is expanded into series on vectorial partial solutions of Lame's equation in a local spheroidal basis. In order to satisfy exactly all interfacial boundary conditions, the re-expansion formulae (addition theorems) for external partial solutions are used. As a result, the primary boundary-value problem of elasticity theory is reduced to an infinite set of linear algebraic equations. The convergence rate of the proposed solution procedure is evaluated numerically. Some numerical results demonstrating the influence on stress distribution of material properties, spatial position of inclusions and external load are presented.},

The orientation order metrics are taken as the structural parameters providing a quantitative measure of disorder, and their variation caused by the gradual disordering of the periodic system is assessed. The effective conductivity of the heterogeneous solid with partially disordered microstructure is evaluated by the multipole expansion method.

Upon use of an implicit time-discretization scheme, the evolution equations describing the constitutive behavior of the phases can be reduced to the minimization of an incremental energy function. This minimization problem is rigorously equivalent to a nonlinear thermoelastic problem with a transformation strain which is a nonuniform field (not even uniform within the phases). In this first part of the study the variational technique of Ponte Casta\~neda is used to approximate the nonuniform eigenstrains by piecewise uniform eigenstrains and to linearize the nonlinear thermoelastic problem. The resulting problem is amenable to simpler calculations and analytical results for appropriate microstructures can be obtained. The accuracy of the proposed scheme is assessed by comparison of the method with exact results. \textcopyright 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The planar crack propagation problem of a flat elliptical crack embedded in a brittle elastic anisotropic solid is investigated. We introduce the concept of crack shape adaptability: the ability of three-dimensional planar cracks to shape with the mechanical properties of a cracked body. A criterion based on the principle of maximum dissipation is suggested in order to determine the most stable elliptical shape. This criterion is applied to the specific case of vertical cracks in transversely isotropic solids. It is shown that contrary to the isotropic case, the circular shape (i.e. penny-shaped cracks) is not the most stable one. Upon propagation, the crack first grows non-self-similarly before it reaches a stable shape. This stable shape can be approximated by an ellipse of an aspect ratio that varies with the degree of elastic anisotropy. By way of example, we apply the so-derived crack shape adaptability criterion to shale materials. For this class of materials it is shown that once the stable shape is reached, the crack propagates at a higher rate in the horizontal direction than in the vertical direction. We also comment on the possible implications of these findings for hydraulic fracturing operations. \textcopyright 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Radar measurements were performed using a commercial radar system with 1.5 GHz ground-coupled antennas. The concrete slabs were conditioned so as to possess different degrees of saturation and a homogeneous moisture distribution. Electrical resistivity measurements were also carried out on each concrete sample to provide complementary information regarding the moisture content of the concrete. Interesting results were found concerning the ability of the radar technique to characterize the moisture state of concrete. Attention was especially focused on the amplitude, velocity and frequency spectrum of the waveforms recorded. In particular, the behavior of the transmitter-receiver direct wave was found to be greatly influenced by the moisture in the concrete. Finally, some experimental results were simulated using a simple dielectric model of heterogeneous mixtures. \textcopyright 2005 RILEM. All rights reserved.},

To do so, the method of Sanahuja (2013) dedicated to spherical inclusions is generalized to ellipsoidal inclusions under the assumption of time-independent Poisson's ratio. The obtained time-dependent strains are successfully compared to those predicted by an existing method dedicated to time-shift aging linear viscoelasticity showing the consistency of the proposed approach. Moreover, full 3D numerical simulations on complex matrix-inclusion microstructures show that the proposed scheme accurately estimates their overall time-dependent strains. Finally, it is shown that an aspect ratio of aggregates in the range 0.3\textendash 3 has no significant influence on the time-dependent strains of composites with per-phase constitutive relations representative of a real concrete.},

A geometric numerical integrator, referred to as a Lie group variational integrator, is developed to numerically preserve the Hamiltonian structure of the presented model and its Lie group configuration manifold. The structure-preserving properties are particularly useful for studying complex dynamics of a tethered spacecraft. These properties are illustrated by numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {The use of bitumen as a construction material dates back to antiquity. The materials in use then were mostly naturally occurring in contrast to modern bitumens which have become highly technical artificial materials. This article reviews the current understanding of bitumen structure and the consequences in terms of properties, with a strong emphasis on the rheological properties. The links between chemistry, structure and mechanical properties are highlighted in the framework of an updated colloidal picture of bitumen. It shows that a simple solvation parameter allows quantifying the effect of the asphaltenes on the rheological properties of bitumen. This appears as a promising approach in order to understand more complex phenomena such as bitumen ageing or the diffusion of rejuvenating oils into an older bitumen. From this structural modelling, the effect of several modifiers, such as polymers, acids or mineral fillers, is explained using fundamental results from the mechanics of colloidal suspensions and multiphase materials through the Palierne model. Thus, relevant parameters describing polymer-bitumen or mineral fillers-bitumen interactions can be extracted, as detailed from literature data. In the case of mineral filler, volume fraction is the key parameter but particle size comes also into play when fine fillers are considered. In the case of polymer-modified bitumens, the swelling extent of the polymer controls all other parameters of importance: volume fraction of dispersed phase and mechanical properties of both dispersed and continuous phases. In addition, interesting rheological features due to droplet shape relaxations are described in polymer-modified bitumens. Although a general picture of bitumen structure is shown to emerge, the many fundamental points that remain to be addressed are discussed throughout the paper. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The coupled electroelastic fields within the inclusion satisfy a system of integral equations solved in a closed form in the case of an ellipsoidal inclusion. The solution is utilized to find the concentration of the electroelastic fields around an inhomogeneity, and to derive the expression for the electric enthalpy of the electroelastic medium with an ellipsoidal inclusion that is relevant for various applications. Explicit closed-form expressions are found for the electroelastic fields within a spheroidal inclusion embedded in the transversely isotropic matrix.

  abstract = {The problem to determine the effective elastic moduli and velocities of elastic wave propagation in transversely isotropic solid containing aligned spheroidal inhomogeneities (solid grains, vugs and micro-cracks) has been solved using the self-consistent scheme known as effective medium approximation (EMA). Since a solution of so-called one-particle problem is a base for each self-consistent method, we solved this problem as a first step for spheroidal inhomogeneity in a transversely isotropic medium. In contrast to the known solution of this problem by Lin and Mura we obtained the expressions for the strain field inside inclusion in the explicit form (without quadratures). The obtained solution was used then in the symmetric variant of the EMA where each component of the system was considered as spheroid with its own aspect ratio. This approach was applied to simulate the properties of the rocks containing isolated pores and micro-cracks. For connected fluid-filled pores we used the anisotropic variant of the Gassmann theory. The results of the calculations, obtained for the effective elastic moduli, have been compared with the experimental data and theoretical simulations of the other authors. Unlike many other rock mechanics theories, EMA approximation gives correct elastic moduli values even in the nondilute concentration of inhomogeneities. The comparison of the experimental data for oriented crack system with the EMA predictions indicates their good correspondence. \textcopyright 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Strain and displacement contour maps were produced to analyze the cracks' initiation and propagation during loading. The testing results indicate that the discrepancy between the elastic moduli of coarse aggregates and mortar matrix significantly influences the mechanical properties and crack patterns of the modeled materials. It is found that the failure process is related to the relative strength of coarse aggregate and mortar matrix. For modeled RAC, the first bond cracks appear around both the old and new interfacial transition zones (ITZ), and then propagate into the old and new mortar matrix by connecting each other. The observation implies that the initiations and propagations of microcracks are different between RAC and Natural Aggregate Concrete (NAC). The findings in this investigation are useful to improve the mechanical properties of RAC by optimizing the mix proportion. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Asphalt binder is a widely used engineering material. It is essentially a nanomaterial with colloidal particles suspended in an oily medium. As asphalt binder ages, the colloidal particles are subject to fundamental physicochemical changes such as agglomeration, which is translated into dramatic engineering property changes of the asphalt binder. In engineering practices, organic rejuvenators are often added to the aged asphalt binder, with the hope of breaking down the nanoparticles and restoring its original engineering properties. However, how the nanoparticles evolve during the aging and rejuvenation of asphalt binder remains hypothetical. This study revealed the fundamental changes of the colloidal particles in asphalt binder during aging and rejuvenation. Moreover, changes in the morphology of colloidal particles are connected to the relaxation spectrum of the asphalt binder. As a result, practitioners do not have to rely on complicated methods and equipment to observe asphalt binders at the microscopic level. Instead, they can employ commonly used engineering tests with a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) to decipher what occurs at the nanoscale during asphalt binder aging and rejuvenation. This would greatly assist practitioners in material selection and design.},

With the tests, the failure processes and crack situation of the recycled concrete under tensile and compressive loadings were illustrated. It was found that some mechanical properties of recycled concrete are similar to those of mortar, for instance, lower Young's modulus, higher peak strain and more brittleness, due to a larger volume content of both new and old hardened mortar. When compared with old hardened mortar, new hardened mortar has more significant influence on both the strength and the Young's modulus of recycled concrete. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this work was to design and manufacture a 3D range-modulator for scanned particle therapy. The modulator is intended to create a highly conformal dose distribution with only one fixed energy, simultaneously reducing considerably the treatment time. As a proof of concept, a 3D range-modulator was developed for a spherical target volume with a diameter of 5 cm, placed at a depth of 25 cm in a water phantom. It consists of a large number of thin pins with a well-defined shape and different lengths to modulate the necessary shift of the Bragg peak. The 3D range-modulator was manufactured with a rapid prototyping technique. The FLUKA Monte Carlo package was used to simulate the modulating effect of the 3D rangemodulator and the resulting dose distribution. For that purpose, a special user routine was implemented to handle its complex geometrical contour. Additionally, FLUKA was extended with the capability of intensity modulated scanning. To validate the simulation results, dose measurements were carried out at the Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Center with a 400.41 MeV/u 12C beam. The high resolution dosimetric measurements show a good agreement between simulated and measured dose distributions. Irradiation of the monoenergetic raster plan took 3 seconds, which is approximately 20 times shorter than a comparable plan with 16 different energies. The combination of only one energy and a 3D range-modulator leads to a tremendous decrease in irradiation time. ``Interplay effects'', typical for moving targets and pencil beam scanning, can be immensely reduced or disappear completely, making the delivery of a homogeneous dose to moving targets more reliable. Combining high dose conformity, very good homogeneity and extremely short irradiation times, the 3D rangemodulator is considered to become a clinically applicable method for very fast treatment of lung tumours.},

In contrast to elastic moduli such as K, G, or E, which always decrease with the addition of pores into a matrix, the Poisson ratio (Formula presented.) may increase, decrease, or remain the same, depending on the shape of the pores, and on the Poisson ratio of the matrix phase, (Formula presented.). In general, for a given pore shape, there is a unique critical Poisson ratio, (Formula presented.), such that the addition of pores into the matrix will cause the Poisson ratio to increase if (Formula presented.), decrease if (Formula presented.), and remain unchanged if (Formula presented.). The critical Poisson ratio for spherical pores is 0.2, for prolate spheroidal pores is close to 0.2, and tends toward zero for thin cracks. For two-dimensional materials, (Formula presented.) for circular pores, 0.306 for squares, 0.227 for equilateral triangles, and again approaches 0 for thin cracks. The presence of a ``trapped'' fluid in the pore space tends to cause (Formula presented.) to increase, and for the range of parameters that may occur in rocks or concrete, this increase is more pronounced for thin crack-like pores than for equi-dimensional pores. Measurements of the Poisson ratio therefore may allow insight into pore geometry and pore fluid. If the matrix phase is strongly auxetic, small amounts of porosity will generally not cause the Poisson ratio to become positive.},

  abstract = {The Eshelby tensor for a plane strain inclusion of arbitrary cross-sectional shape is first presented in a general form, which has 15 independent non-zero components (as opposed to 36 such components for a three-dimensional inclusion of arbitrary shape). It is based on a simplified strain gradient elasticity theory that involves one material length scale parameter. The Eshelby tensor for an infinitely long cylindrical inclusion is then derived using the general form, with its components obtained in explicit (closed-form) expressions for the two regions inside and outside the inclusion for the first time based on a higher-order elasticity theory. This Eshelby tensor is separated into a classical part and a gradient part. The latter depends on the position, the inclusion size, the length scale parameter, and Poisson's ratio. As a result, the new Eshelby tensor is non-uniform even inside the cylindrical inclusion and captures the size effect. When the strain gradient effect is not considered, the gradient part vanishes and the newly obtained Eshelby tensor reduces to its counterpart based on classical elasticity. The numerical results quantitatively show that the components of the new Eshelby tensor vary with the position, the inclusion size, and the material length scale parameter, unlike their classical elasticity-based counterparts. When the inclusion radius is comparable to the material length scale parameter, it is found that the gradient part is too large to be ignored. In view of the need for homogenization analyses of fiber-reinforced composites, the volume average of the newly derived Eshelby tensor over the cylindrical inclusion is obtained in a closed form. The components of the average Eshelby tensor are observed to depend on the inclusion size: the smaller the inclusion radius, the smaller the components. However, as the inclusion size becomes sufficiently large, these components are seen to approach from below the values of their classical elasticity-based counterparts. \textcopyright 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the solution of a class of plane elasticity problems for circular inhomogeneous inclusions with non-uniform radially varying axis-symmetrical dilatational eigenstrain. First, the fundamental solution for a point-wise eigenstrain in an infinite plane solid is presented. Next the circular homogeneous inclusion problem is formulated using Green's function method. By using the principle of equivalent eigenstrain recently proposed (Ma and Korsunsky, 2014, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 51, 4477-4484), the main difficulty in solving inhomogeneous inclusion problems is overcome through the use of the equivalent uniform eigenstrain formulation, allowing the general explicit analytical solution to be derived. Based on these results, two illustrative examples of practical significance are solved: (i) the thermo-elastic problem of a point heat source at the centre of a circular inclusion, and (ii) the problem of a circular inclusion with interface eigenstrain that applies in the case of nano-scale inclusions. The fundamental formulation introduced here will find application in other aspects in the mechanics of fibre composites, thermoelasticity, and nano-mechanics of defects in solids.},

  abstract = {Assessing the overall instantaneous behavior and strength properties of jointed materials have been the subject of important investigations in the last decades, including phenomenological or micromechanics-based contributions. However, less attention has been dedicated to delayed component of deformation in such media. This issue is addressed in this paper, which is devoted to the formulation of a micromechanical approach to effective viscoelastic properties of jointed rocks with consideration of constituents aging. At the scale of representative elementary volume (REV), the joints are modeled as planar interfaces whose behavior is described by means of generalized viscoelastic state equations under normal and shear loading conditions. Closed-form expressions for the homogenized creep tensor are derived from solving an appropriate viscoelastic concentration problem stated on the REV. The local strain and displacement jump fields are analyzed by extending the concept of strain concentration to relate the components of joint displacement jump to macroscopic strain. Main features of the theoretical overall creep behavior, such as the anisotropy associated with the privileged joint orientations, are highlighted through explicit formulations in some particular configurations of the jointed medium. Finally, the ability of the approach to accurately reproduce the creep behavior of jointed media is assessed by comparison with experimental data as well as with finite element solutions derived in the context of multilayered stratified composite modeling.},

Finite Element simulations are carried out using periodic unit cells with cubic arrangements of spherical particles and representative volume elements (RVE) with 50 randomly placed inclusions. In addition to the analysis of the packing effect in two-phase composites, the size effect is also studied by assuming an interphase between the matrix and inclusions.

It is shown next, with the aid of two complementary hypotheses, that these more general relations retain the same properties as those of Koiter. In conclusion, it is shown that these two hypotheses permit the finding of all the classical theorems of the theory of the plastic potential, as well as the properties of waves and surfaces of discontinuity established before for the case of a simple plastic potential. \textcopyright{} 1965.},

  abstract = {The linear viscoelastic (LVE) behaviour of several combinations of two binders, a straight run 35/50 bitumen and a RAP-extracted bitumen in various proportions (20\%, 40\% and 60\% of RAP binder), was simulated. Two different methods were used to carry out the simulations, The first method consists of a blending rule from the 2S2P1D (2 Springs, 2 Parabolic elements, 1 Dashpot) rheological model, that was calibrated for straight run bitumen and RAP. The second approach is based on the self-consistent model proposed by Herv\'e and Zaoui [1], considering the two binders as a layered composite sphere embedded in a homogenous medium. Both possible juxtapositions, 35/50 binder over RAP binder (``fresh over RAP'') and vice versa (``RAP over fresh''), were taken into account. All the simulations were compared with 2S2P1D simulations of experimental data obtained from DSR and Tension/Compression tests on samples of perfect blends of the binders, in the same proportions. The two methods yielded different results. Simulations obtained with the blending rule are remarkably close to 2S2P1D simulations of experimental data. ``Fresh over RAP'' simulations of the self consistent approach are closer than ``RAP over fresh'' simulations to the results obtained with the blending rule. A statistical analysis was also performed to compare all the considered combinations. Norm (|E*|) and phase angle ({$\phi$}) of complex modulus at different frequencies (from 1 \texttimes{} 10-6 to 1 \texttimes{} 10100 Hz) and steady state viscosity (calculated from norm of complex viscosity, |{$\eta$}*|, at 1 \texttimes{} 10-100 Hz) were considered as responses. First, a block design approach was used to estimate that significant differences were obtained between all various simulations and 2S2P1D fits of experimental data. Then, the Turkey method was applied in order to compare all combinations with each other and to identify which pairs of combinations show significant differences. The results of the statistical analysis generally confirm the conclusions drawn from the visual judgment of the rheological simulations.},

Whereas micromechanical models derived from the classical 'point approach' are known to be unable to model such effects, it is shown that the so-called 'morphologically representative pattern-based approach' (MRP-based approach) offers new means of taking some geometrical parameters into account such as the mean distance between nearest-neighbor particles or their size, so as to predict the dependence of the overall moduli on these parameters, at least in a relative way. Moreover, when internal lengths, such as the thickness of interphase shells of coated particles, are introduced, absolute size effects can be predicted as well. Illustrative applications are reported in view of comparisons between such new treatments and the predictions of some classical models which are shown to coincide with the ones derived from MRP-based models in definite limiting cases only. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Consistency of the results obtained by these methods is observed in most cases. Applicability of replacement relations that predict the contribution to the overall elastic properties of inhomogeneities with different elastic properties, but the same shape, was analyzed. The replacement relations provide considerably good approximation for ``soft'' inclusions (Young's modulus lower than the matrix') only, in certain cases wrong approximation trends were observed. It was possible to propose an adjustment tensor for the replacement relations which components depend linearly on the face curvature.},

If the body exhibits orthotropic symmetry, these roots are explicitly given as a function of the independent components of the elasticity tensor. Similarly, the double integral is reduced to a simple one when the body is three-dimensional. The corresponding integrand depends on the three pairs of complex conjugate roots of a sextic equation which reduces to a cubic one for orthotropic symmetry. This new expression improves significantly the computation times when the degree of anisotropy is high. For both two and three-dimensional bodies, degenerate cases are also studied to yield valid expressions in any events.},

C'est en particulier le cas des mat\'eriaux de structure pr\'esentant un comportement \'elasto-viscoplastique et soumis \`a un trajet de chargement non monotone et non isotherme. Progresser sur le traitement par homog\'en\'eisation de ces situations concr\`etes constitue pr\'ecis\'ement le fil conducteur des diff\'erentes contributions pr\'esent\'ees dans ce m\'emoire d'HDR. Dans le cas \'elastique lin\'eaire, de nouvelles expressions pour le calcul du tenseur d'Eshelby sont tout d'abord \'etablies afin d'am\'eliorer l'efficacit\'e des m\'ethodes d'homog\'en\'eisation habituellement propos\'ees. Toujours pour des comportements lin\'eaires mais \`a pr\'esent visco\'elastique, diff\'erentes approximations associ\'ees \`a l'utilisation du th\'eor\`eme de correspondance sont \'etudi\'ees et compar\'ees. On montre notamment l'\'equivalence d'une de ces approximations (la m\'ethode des collocations) avec une formulation \`a variables internes du comportement effectif. Cette formulation \`a variables internes conduit \`a des r\'esultats exacts dans certaines situations et simplifie notablement le traitement des comportements visco\'elastiques lin\'eaires vieillissants. Dans le cas des comportements \'elasto-viscoplastiques, s'ajoute \`a la difficult\'e pr\'ec\'edente (couplage visco\'elastique) celle du traitement des non lin\'earit\'es. Des comparaisons \'etablies entre diff\'erentes familles d'estimation permettent de bien cerner les effets des diff\'erentes approximations n\'ecessaires pour traiter ces non lin\'earit\'es. Une proposition d'am\'elioration est m\^eme formul\'ee et mise en \o euvre dans un cas particulier. On montre ensuite comment d\'ecliner l'approche par variables internes dans ce cas non lin\'eaire. Enfin, la question des calculs de microstructures est aussi abord\'ee en consid\'erant le cas particulier o\`u des zones de l'\'el\'ement de volume consid\'er\'e ont des propri\'et\'es m\'ecaniques mal d\'efinies. Dans le cas \'elastique lin\'eaire, de nouvelles bornes pour le comportement effectif sont \'etablies en mariant le calcul de structure et une approche variationnelle de type Hashin et Shtrikman. Ce dernier point ouvre sur des perspectives de recherche importantes : bornes plus resserr\'ees, comportements non lin\'eaires, \textbackslash ldotsC\^ot\'e m\'ethodes d'homog\'en\'eisation, des perspectives pr\'ecises sont aussi d\'efinies, en particulier pour les mat\'eriaux poly-cristallins, situation pour laquelle le champ d'investigation s'\'elargit nettement (fatigue, grandes d\'eformations, \textbackslash ldots) gr\^ace \`a la formulation \`a variables internes propos\'ee. Enfin, la simulation des effets d'irradiation constitue le troisi\`eme th\`eme d'int\'er\^et pour les ann\'ees \`a venir, l'objectif g\'en\'eral \'etant de mieux pr\'edire les effets des d\'eformations de gonflement induites par l'irradiation sur le comportement des structures en service.},

  abstract = {Elastic interactions of cracks arbitrarily oriented in a 2-D anisotropic matrix are analyzed. The impact of material's anisotropy on mechanics of interactions is found to be significant. The anisotropy of Young's moduli produces the strongest impact: it enhances (weakens) the interactions under a loading applied in the stiffer (softer) direction. Sensitivity to the shear modulus is somewhat lower and the impact of Poisson's ratios is small. Crack-microcrack interactions are analysed and compared with the ones in the isotropic matrix. If the main crack is normal to the stiffer direction of the matrix, the anisotropy noticeably enhances the microcrack's impact; for the crack normal to the softer direction, the influence of anisotropy is found to be insignificant. Effective molduli of anisotropic materials with arbitrarily oriented interacting cracks are derived in companion papers [26,27]. \textcopyright 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

  abstract = {We derive the explicit analytical expressions of the phase velocities of the three bulk waves (qP, qS1 and qS2) propagating in an arbitrary direction in a homogeneous strongly anisotropic medium of arbitrary symmetry (triclinic). The mathematical formulation is concise and symmetrical with respect to all the wave types. A simple geometrical interpretation of the formulae is proposed. The conciseness of the formalism hides the great complexity of the solutions when they are explicitly expressed in terms of the elastic constants of the media and of the direction cosines of the unit propagation vector, which makes further analytical developments daunting. We use perturbation techniques to derive simplified approximate expressions of these solutions. In a continuation of the work of Thomsen (1986) in weakly transversely isotropic media, we extend the work of Sayers (1994) in arbitrary weakly anisotropic media, but restricted to qP waves, by deriving the complete directional dependence of the velocities of the three bulk waves (qP, qS1 and qS2). Furthermore, contrary to the previous references, we do not need to assume that the anisotropy is weak since our model is based on the perturbation of a reference model which can exhibit strong S-wave birefringence. We do not use spherical harmonic decomposition, as Sayers (1994) did, but only elementary rotations of the components of the elastic tensor of the considered medium. The forms of the proposed solutions naturally introduce generalizations of Thomsen's classical parameters {$\epsilon$}, {$\delta$} and {$\gamma$}, but they are relevant for arbitrary symmetry. Numerical comparisons between the exact and the approximate velocities using perturbation theory in transversely isotropic and triclinic media validate the proposed solutions, and show that the first-order approximations are reasonable even in the presence of a moderate amount of anisotropy.},

  abstract = {The computational modeling of failure mechanisms in solids due to fracture based on sharp crack discontinuities suffers in situations with complex crack topologies. This can be overcome by a diffusive crack modeling based on the introduction of a crack phase field. Following our recent work [C. Miehe, F. Welschinger, M. Hofacker, Thermodynamically-consistent phase field models of fracture: Variational principles and multi-field fe implementations, International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering DOI:10.1002/nme.2861] on phase-field-type fracture, we propose in this paper a new variational framework for rate-independent diffusive fracture that bases on the introduction of a local history field. It contains a maximum reference energy obtained in the deformation history, which may be considered as a measure for the maximum tensile strain obtained in history. It is shown that this local variable drives the evolution of the crack phase field. The introduction of the history field provides a very transparent representation of the balance equation that governs the diffusive crack topology. In particular, it allows for the construction of a new algorithmic treatment of diffusive fracture. Here, we propose an extremely robust operator split scheme that successively updates in a typical time step the history field, the crack phase field and finally the displacement field. A regularization based on a viscous crack resistance that even enhances the robustness of the algorithm may easily be added. The proposed algorithm is considered to be the canonically simple scheme for the treatment of diffusive fracture in elastic solids. We demonstrate the performance of the phase field formulation of fracture by means of representative numerical examples. \textcopyright 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {A new constitutive model for fibre reinforced cementitious composites based on micromechanical solutions is proposed. The model employs a two-phase composite based on the Eshelby matrix-inclusion solution and the Mori\textendash Tanaka homogenization scheme and also simulates directional microcracking. An exterior point Eshelby based criterion is employed to model crack-initiation in the matrix-inclusion interface. Microcrack surfaces are assumed to be rough and able to regain contact under both normal and shear displacements. Fibres are included into the formulation in both cracked and uncracked conditions. Once cracks start to develop, the crack-bridging action of fibres is simulated using a local constitutive equation that accounts for the debonding and pull-out of fibre groups with different orientations. It is shown that the combination of the rough microcrack and fibre-bridging sub-models allows microcracking behaviour deriving from both tensile and compressive loads to be modelled in a unified manner. This ability to model tensile and compressive behaviour using the same micromechanical mechanisms is considered to be a particularly attractive feature of the formulation, which removes the need for multi-parameter triaxial yield surfaces and evolution functions that bedevil many competitor models. The model is successfully validated using a series of examples based on experimental test data.},

These yield solutions that are invariant under inversion, i.e., the same whether elastic stiffness or compliance are considered. The Frobenius distance function, which corresponds to common notions of Euclidean length, is not invariant although it is simple to apply using projection operators. A complete description of the Euclidean projection method is presented. The three metrics are considered at a level of detail far greater than heretofore, as we develop the general framework to best fit a given set of moduli onto higher elastic symmetries.

As part of a PhD project, fundamental testing at micro- and nano-levels was undertaken to achieve better understanding of the blending and diffusion phenomenon between rheologically and chemically different bitumens. Three different techniques were used to observe the interface zones of bitumen-bitumen and aggregate-bitumen zones. Nanoindentation, nano-computed tomography (nano-CT) scanning and optical microscopy were done on three different groups of prepared samples. Nanoindentation was conducted to evaluate the difference of surface stiffness of aggregate binder interfaces. Nano-CT scanning techniques were used to observe slight differences in density of the interface in binder zones. Optical microscopy was conducted on thin sections of an asphalt mixture to detect the interface zone between two binders. With nano-CT scanning, it is possible to see the separation zone between the hard- and soft-grade bitumen. Nano-CT scanning images on two different bitumens clearly showed the two bitumen layers due to their varying densities but it was not possible to detect two different binders inside the mixture. Initial results from the nanoindentation study illustrated the benefit of using nanoindentation in detecting two different binders. It was not possible to detect hard and soft bitumens from optical microscopy images on thin sections. Differences in enhanced colours in some points were caused by their difference in thickness. The three-dimensional analysis of bitumen nano-CT images seems to be in reasonable agreement with the assumed bitumen microstructure but further research is needed to confirm this. \textcopyright 2014 Taylor \& Francis.},

The zero order approximation of our scheme, coincides with the Mori-Tanaka method when the inclusions are spherical, but improves significantly this method when higher order approximations are considered. The morphological and spatial distribution of the inclusions is accounted for in our scheme. Through different examples, it is shown how our results compare to existing analytical or numerical solutions. Copyright \textcopyright{} 1996 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {The aim of this short paper is to provide, for elasticity tensors, generalized Euclidean distances that preserve the property of invariance by inversion. First, the elasticity law is expressed under a non-dimensional form by means of a gauge, which leads to an expression of elasticity (stiffness or compliance) tensors without units. Based on the difference between functions of the dimensionless tensors, generalized Euclidean distances are then introduced. A subclass of functions is proposed, which permits the retrieval of the classical log-Euclidean distance and the derivation of new distances, namely the arctan-Euclidean and power-Euclidean distances. Finally, these distances are applied to the determination of the closest isotropic tensor to a given elasticity tensor.},

First, the case of elastic nonhomogeneous constituents is considered and an iterative procedure is proposed to solve the Lippman-Schwinger equation which naturally arises in the problem. Then, the method is extended to non-linear constituents by a step-by-step integration in time. The accuracy of the method is assessed by varying the spatial resolution of the microstructures.

Numerical examples are provided, verifying the convergence of the results for the macroscopic conductivity obtained from the minimum energy upper and lower bound approaches, and also that derived from the differential one. Explicit formal and numerical expressions of the microscopic conduction fields and illustration pictures of the microscopic flux lines within and around the typical anisotropic coating inclusion are also given.

These imperfect interfaces are described by the highly conducting, lowly conducting or general thermal imperfect model. To achieve the objective, the classical Hill-Mendel lemma is first extended to include the effects of imperfect interfaces and an equivalent inclusion method (EIM) is proposed. The basic idea of EIM is to replace an inclusion embedded in a matrix via an imperfect interface by an equivalent inclusion inserted in the same matrix via a perfect interface. Using EIM and applying the dilute distribution, Mori-Tanaka, self-consistent, generalized self-consistent and differential schemes, the effective thermal conductivities of layered composites and some particle-reinforced composites with imperfect interfaces are analytically and explicitly determined. These results are compared with the Voigt, Reuss and Hashin-Shtrikman bounds and checked against the numerical results provided by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) method. These comparisons and checks show that the methods proposed in this work are particularly efficient. The methods and results of the present work are directly transposable to other transport phenomena and anti-plane elasticity by their strict mathematical analogy with thermal conduction.},

At the steel\textendash concrete interface, irreversible corrosion process occurs in parallel with reversible redox reactions involving Fe2+ and Fe3+ species that interfere in the electrochemical estimation of the corrosion rate.

A database of complex modulus results of unmodified bitumens, polymer modified bitumens (PMBs), bitumen-filler mastics, unaged and aged bitumens was used together with a Generalized Logistic Sigmoidal Model to assess the validity of seven different shifting approaches. Except for the Laboratoire Central des Ponts et Chauss\'ees (LCPC) method, the construction of master curves was done using the Generalised Logistic Sigmoidal Model and non-linear least squares regression optimization with the aid of the Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet Solver function. The goodness-of-fit for the various shifting techniques and functions was assessed through graphical and statistical methods. From the study, it was found that a numerical shift approach using non-linear least squares produced the best fit between experimental and predicted data in terms of both graphical and goodness-of-fit statistics. The ranking of the other shifting techniques consisted of the LCPC approach, followed by the William, Landel and Ferry (WLF), Modified Kaelble, Viscosity Temperature Susceptibility (VTS), Arrhenius and Log-Linear methods. However, most of the equations are basically empirical and they are not expected to be strictly obeyed by any materials. Discrepancies were still evident, even for the better functions, for those materials that demonstrated a deviation from the thermorheological simplicity of the rheological behaviour as found for highly structured bitumens following high degrees of polymer modification and/or oxidative ageing. \textcopyright{} Chinese Society of Pavement Engineering.},

  abstract = {The elastic moduli of a solid permeated with an isotropic distribution of flat cracks have been calculated from the energy of a single crack by use of a self-consistent approximation. The results are applicable for a dense network of cracks and give physically reasonable results up to the point that the shear modulus vanishes. Results for both circular and elliptical cracks are essentially the same if the crack density is characterized by 2N{$\langle$}A2/P{$\rangle$}/{$\pi$}, where N is the number of cracks per unit volume, A is the area of crack, and P is the perimeter of cracks; for circular cracks of radius a this becomes N{$\langle$}a3{$\rangle$}. This crack density parameter can be related quantitatively to crack traces observed in thin section. Results for completely dry or saturated cracks, for mixtures of dry and saturated cracks, and for cracks saturated with a compressible fluid are presented. For all cases, both seismic wave velocities decrease with increasing crack density. The velocity ratio VP/VS decreases for dry cracks and increases for saturated cracks. For the analysis of data a plot of VP/VS versus VS uniquely specifies the crack density. Comparison of the theory with wave velocities measured in laboratory rock samples demonstrates its validity for large crack densities. Interpretation of velocity changes before the San Fernando earthquake indicates that the region contained a substantial density of cracks at all times, that the anomalous decrease in VP/VS was due to the vaporization of pore fluid in nearly all of the previously saturated cracks without the introduction of new dry cracks, and that during the period of the recovery of the velocities to previous values the number of cracks in the region away from the epicentral zone decreased as they were resaturated, whereas the crack density increased following resaturation in the epicentral zone. Such use of the theoretical results may be useful in further investigations of preseismic phenomena.},

In this review, the physical changes in the molecular structure of epoxies are described, and the influence of these changes on the bulk-level response is detailed. Specifically, the influence of physical aging on the quasistatic mechanical properties, viscoelasticity, fracture toughness, thermal expansion coefficient, volume relaxation, enthalpy relaxation, endothermic peak temperature, fictive temperature, and moisture/solvent absorption capability is reviewed. Also discussed are relationships between relaxation functions, crosslink density, composite reinforcement, and epoxy/copolymer blending and the physical aging response of epoxies.

  abstract = {The lack of understanding the mechanisms governing the interaction between reclaimed asphalt binder (RAb)1 and recycling agents is one of the technical issues that still need to be resolved when high amount of reclaimed asphalt (RA)2 is used in a new recycled asphalt mixture (RAM). Due to important role of RAb in that interaction and increased used of RA, it becomes necessary to have a way to classify RA, as any other material used in asphalt mixture production. It is very important to determine how much RAb is active by itself (DoA)3, but also to determine how much RAb can be considered available for a mix design of RAM (DoAv)4 when a recycling agent is used. Finally, since that RAM's properties are strongly dependent on the degree of blending between RAb and recycling agent (DoB)5, it should evaluate to what extent RAb contributes to the final properties of RAM. These blending parameters (DoA, DoAv and DoB) are so crucial that identifying suitable methodologies for their assessment would be extremely important in performing a proper mix design due to dangerous of having a lack of active bitumen in RAM. This paper presents a literature review of methods which have been used for the evaluation and assessment of mentioned parameters, grouped in four macro-areas: mechanical, chemical, visualization and mechanistic approaches. Furthermore, summarized review of used methods was prepared together with their critical review, all with aim to find appropriate methods for determining these parameters.},

  abstract = {Early-age stiffness and strength evolution of cement paste is studied in the framework of continuum micromechanics. Based on the self-consistent scheme, elastic and strength properties are upscaled from the scale of several micrometers up to the scale of several hundreds or thousands of micrometers. Four material phases are considered: clinker, hydration products, water and air. We assign a spherical geometry to clinker grains and pores, while we investigate both spherical and acicular (needle-type) shapes as geometrical rep- resentation of the micrometer-sized hydration products. As regards macroscopic poromechanical boundary conditions, two extreme cases are considered: drained conditions and sealed conditions, respectively. These choices allow for studying the influence of (i) the morphological representation of hydrates, and of (ii) the bulk stiffness of water, on the micromechanical prediction of early-age behavior of cement paste, including setting and the hydration-dependent evolutions of both elastic stiffness and uniaxial compressive strength. The newly proposed strength model is based on a von Mises-type elastic limit criterion for individual hydrates. Corresponding deviatoric stress peaks within hydrates are estimated through quadratic stress averages. In this way, themicromechanical strength criterion is formulated in terms ofmacroscopic loading (stresses or strains, respectively). Model-predicted elasticity and strength evolutions are compared with data from experimental testing of cement pastes with water\textendash cement ratios ranging from 0.35 to 0.60. Satisfactory agreement between model predictions and experiments allows for two conclusions: the morphology of hydrates significantly influ- ences micromechanics-based elastic stiffness estimates of cement paste particularly at very early ages,whereas elastic properties of mature cement paste can be estimated reliably on the basis of both spherical or acicular shaped hydrates. The development of a reliable strength model, however, requires consideration of hydrates as non-spherical particles, no matter what age of cement paste is considered.},

Within the framework of continuum micromechanics, we here derive these tensors from extended Eshelby-Laws matrix-inclusion problems, considering, as a new feature, an auxiliary matrix eigenstress. The auxiliary matrix eigenstress is a function of all phase eigenstresses and, hence, accounts for eigenstress interaction. If all material phases are associated with one and the same Hill tensor, the proposed method degenerates to the well-accepted transformation field analysis. Hence, the proposed concept can be interpreted as an extension of the transformation field analysis toward consideration of arbitrarily many Hill tensors, i.e., as an extension toward heterogeneous elastic media comprising inclusion phases with an arbitrary ellipsoidal shape and with arbitrary spatial orientation. This is of particular interest when studying heterogeneous media consis...},

It is less known about the microstructural material characteristics which drive this dependence, nor about the nature of the hydration degree\textendash strength relationship before the aforementioned critical hydration degree is reached. In order to elucidate the latter issues, we here present a micromechanical explanation for the hydration degree\textendash strength relationships of cement pastes and mortars covering a large range of compositions: Therefore, we envision, at a scale of fifteen to twenty microns, a hydrate foam (comprising spherical water and air phases, as well as needle-shaped hydrate phases oriented isotropically in all space directions), which, at a higher scale of several hundred microns, acts as a contiguous matrix in which cement grains are embedded as spherical clinker inclusions. Mortar is represented as a contiguous cement paste matrix with spherical sand grain inclusions. Failure of the most unfavorably stressed hydrate phase is associated with overall (quasi-brittle) failure of cement paste or mortar. After careful experimental validation, our modeling approach strongly suggests that it is the mixture- and hydration degree-dependent load transfer of overall, material sample-related, uniaxial compressive stress states down to deviatoric stress peaks within the hydrate phases triggering local failure, which determines the first nonlinear, and then linear dependence of quasi-brittle strength of cementitious materials on the degree of hydration.},

In the formulation of the law, the paper distinguishes between macroscopic and microscopic features of the contact surface. Through macroscope considerations. an incremental constitutive law is derived which is applicable to a large class of contact-friction problems. By idealizing the microstructure to consist of interlocking asperity surfaces, the constitutive equations are specialized for the description of rock joints including effects such as dilatancy, asperity surface degradation and bulking. Several examples are considered demonstrating the law's behaviour and agreement with experimental data. The incremental form of the equations that are derived are amenable to implementation in numerical procedures such as finite element and discrete element (rigid block) computer programs.},

These families recover a large variety of models introduced in recent years for damaged materials or as effective modulus of heterogeneous materials. On the other hand, ellipsoidal anisotropy has been used as a guideline in phenomenological modeling of materials. A question that then naturally arises is to know in which conditions the assumption that some indicator surfaces are ellipsoidal allows one to entirely determine the elastic constants. This question has not been rigorously studied in the literature. In this paper, first several basic classes of ellipsoidal anisotropy are presented. Then the problem of determination of the elastic parameters from indicator surfaces is discussed in several basic cases that can occur in phenomenological modelling. Finally the compatibility between the assumption of ellipsoidal form for different indicator surfaces is discussed and in particular, it is shown that if the indicator surfaces of the fourth root of E(n) and of 1/c(n) where E(n) and c(n) are respectively the Young's modulus and the elastic coefficient in the direction n) are ellipsoidal, then the two ellipsoids have necessarily the same principal axes and the material in this case is orthotropic.},

An explicit nondegenerate\textbackslash nGreen function solution is established for these materials. Then,\textbackslash nit is shown that the ellipsoidal model recovers a variety of phenomenological\textbackslash nand theoretical models used in recent years, specifically for geomaterials\textbackslash nand damaged or micro-cracked materials. These models can be used\textbackslash nto approximate the elastic parameters of any anisotropic material\textbackslash nwith different fitting qualities. A method to optimize the parameters\textbackslash nwill be given.},

The imperfect interface is modeled by a linear spring-layer of vanishing thickness. The Mori-Tanaka estimate and its modification are used to evaluate the effective moduli of composites having slightly weakened interfaces. An interface is said to be slightly weakened, if the compliance of the spring-layer is very small. As an example, a composite consisting of aligned ellipsoidal particles is considered in detail. Explicit expressions of the Mori-Tanaka estimates of the effective moduli are derived when the particles are spherical. Based on classical minimum energy principles, upper and lower bounds of the effective moduli of composites with imperfect interfaces are also derived. \textcopyright 1993.},

  abstract = {We analyse the relation between rock fabric, expressed by the preferred orientation of rock-forming minerals and microcracks, and elastic anisotropy of crystalline rock from the KTB pilot well. Detailed analyses of mineralogical composition, textures and microcrack fabrics were performed. In addition, ultrasonic velocity measurements of spherical samples in several directions were carried out at various confining pressures, and inverted in terms of the complete set of 21 elastic constants. By comparing the elastic tensors of the rocks at the final confining pressure (at which most of the microcracks are closed) with those at a lower pressure level, it is possible to separate the anisotropy induced by microcracks from that caused by mineral alignment. In contrast to previous work, no a priori knowledge of the type of anisotropy (triclinic, monoclinic, orthotropic etc.), or of the spatial orientation of the symmetry elements (planes, axes) of the cracked rock or of the intact rock is assumed. Furthermore, no restrictive assumptions on the orientation distribution function and the shape of the cracks are needed. The results show that the elastic anisotropy characteristics, whether they are related to the microcracks or to the rock-forming minerals, are clearly correlated with the directly observed rock fabrics. We show that the symmetry directions of the mineral fabric and of microcrack fabric agree. A further result is that the microcrack-induced anisotropy dominates the other causes of anisotropy at confining pressures smaller than a few tens of megapascals, the situation being reversed at higher pressures. The laboratory data are quantitatively compared with sonic log data from the KTB well, showing the influence of pore fluids, effective pressure and crack density reduction on the anisotropy in situ.},

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful technique for characterizing a wide variety of electrochemical systems and for determining the contribution of electrode or electrolytic processes in these systems. The analysis of EIS results on samples of concrete is highly complex due to overlapping arcs from simultaneous phenomena and noise measurement, of course, associated with the heterogeneity of the samples and that complicate the analysis considerably. Thus, this paper proposes a new form of analysis based on the characteristic relaxation angular frequency, w, of each phenomenon and associating the typical capacitances and frequencies.ResumoEntre as t\'ecnicas mais utilizadas para a avalia\c{c}\~ao e estudo da corros\~ao em concreto armado est\~ao as t\'ecnicas eletroqu\'imicas, entre elas a espectroscopia de imped\^ancia eletroqu\'imica (EIE).

  abstract = {A line integral is exhibited which has the same value for all paths surrounding the tip of a notch in the two-dimensional strain field of an elastic or deformation-type elastic-plastic material. Appropriate integration path choices serve both to relate the integral to the near tip deformations and, in many cases, to permit its direct evaluation. This averaged measure of the near tip field leads to approximate solutions for several strain-concentration problems. Contained perfectly plastic deformation near a crack tip is analyzed for the plane-strain case with the aid of the slip-line theory. Near tip stresses are shown to be significantly elevated by hydrostatic tension, and a strain singularity results varying inversely with distance from the tip in centered fan regions above and below the tip. Approximate estimates are given for the strain intensity, plastic zone size, and crack tip opening displacement, and the important role of large geometry changes in crack blunting is noted. Another application leads to a general solution for crack tip separations in the Barenblatt-Dugdale crack model. A proof follows on the equivalence of the Griffith energy balance and cohesive force theories of elastic brittle fracture, and hardening behavior is included in a model for plane-stress yielding. A final application leads to approximate estimates of strain concentrations at smooth-ended notch tips in elastic and elastic-plastic materials.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a review of hydromechanical (HM) couplings in fractured rock, with special emphasis on HM interactions as a result of, or directly connected with human activities. In the early 1960s, the coupling between hydraulic and mechanical processes in fractured rock started to receive wide attention. A series of events including dam failures, landslides, and injection-induced earthquakes were believed to result from HM interaction. Moreover, the advent of the computer technology in the 1970s made possible the integration of nonlinear processes such as stress\textendash permeability coupling and rock mass failure into coupled HM analysis. Coupled HM analysis is currently being applied to many geological engineering practices. One key parameter in such analyses is a good estimate of the relationship between stress and permeability. Based on available laboratory and field data, it was found that the permeability of fractured rock masses tends to be most sensitive to stress changes at shallow depth (low stress) and in areas of low in-situ permeability. In highly permeable, fractured rock sections, fluid flow may take place in clusters of connected fractures which are locked open as a result of previous shear dislocation or partial cementation of hard mineral filling. Such locked-open fractures tend to be relatively insensitive to stress and may therefore be conductive at great depths. Because of the great variability of HM properties in fractured rock, and the difficulties in using laboratory data for deriving in-situ material properties, the HM properties of fractured rock masses are best characterized in situ.},

  abstract = {This work evaluates and improves upon existing effective medium methods for permeability upscaling in fractured media. Specifically, we are concerned with the asymmetric self-consistent, symmetric self-consistent, and differential methods. In effective medium theory, inhomogeneity is modeled as ellipsoidal inclusions embedded in the rock matrix. Fractured media correspond to the limiting case of flat ellipsoids, for which we derive a novel set of simplified formulas. The new formulas have improved numerical stability properties, and require a smaller number of input parameters. To assess their accuracy, we compare the analytical permeability predictions with three-dimensional finite-element simulations. We also compare the results with a semi-analytical method based on percolation theory and curve-fitting, which represents an alternative upscaling approach. A large number of cases is considered, with varying fracture aperture, density, matrix/fracture permeability contrast, orientation, shape, and number of fracture sets. The differential method is seen to be the best choice for sealed fractures and thin open fractures. For high-permeable, connected fractures, the semi-analytical method provides the best fit to the numerical data, whereas the differential method breaks down. The two self-consistent methods can be used for both unconnected and connected fractures, although the asymmetric method is somewhat unreliable for sealed fractures. For open fractures, the symmetric method is generally the more accurate for moderate fracture densities, but only the asymmetric method is seen to have correct asymptotic behavior. The asymmetric method is also surprisingly accurate at predicting percolation thresholds. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

  abstract = {In this work, we assess the use of explicit methods for estimating the effective conductivity of anisotropic fractured media. Explicit methods are faster and simpler to use than implicit methods but may have a more limited range of validity. Five explicit methods are considered: the Maxwell approximation, the T-matrix method, the symmetric and asymmetric weakly self-consistent methods, and the weakly differential method, where the two latter methods are novelly constructed in this paper. For each method, we develop simplified expressions applicable to flat spheroidal "penny-shaped" inclusions. The simplified expressions are accurate to the first order in the ratio of fracture thickness to fracture diameter. Our analysis shows that the conductivity predictions of the methods fall within known upper and lower bounds, except for the T-matrix method at high fracture densities and the symmetric weakly self-consistent method when applied to very thin fractures. Comparisons with numerical results show that all the methods give reliable estimates for small fracture densities. For high fracture densities, the weakly differential method is the most accurate if the fracture geometry is non-percolating or the fracture/matrix conductivity contrast is small. For percolating conductive fracture networks, we have developed a scaling relation that can be applied to the weakly self-consistent methods to give conductivity estimates that are close to the results from numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {Paper is a complex material consisting of a network of cellulose fibres at the micro-level. During manufacturing, the network is dried under restraint conditions due to tension in the paper web in machine direction. This gives rise to internal strains that are stored in the produced sheet. Upon exposure to a moisture cycle, these strains may be released. This results in permanent shrinkage that may cause instabilities such as curl or waviness of the sheet. The prime objective of this paper is to model this irreversible shrinkage and to link its magnitude to the properties of the fibres and of the network. For this purpose, randomly generated fibrous networks of different coverages (i.e. ratio of the area occupied by fibres and that of the sheet) are modeled by means of a periodic representative volume element (RVE). Within such RVEs, a finite element method combined with a kinematic hardening plasticity model at the scale of the fibres is used to capture the irreversible response. The computational results obtained demonstrate that the magnitude of the irreversible strains increases with coverage until a certain coverage and beyond that coverage decreases in magnitude. This phenomenon is explained by considering the area fraction of free-standing fibre segments relative to bonded fibre segments in the network. A structure\textendash property dependency of irreversible strains at the sheet-level on the micro-structural parameters of the network is thereby established.},

In fact, behind this question, we can identify two issues: \textbullet{} Can the morphology be accurately described? \textbullet{} Can a simplified (modelled) representation of the morphology be established to properly predict the effective properties of the material especially over a range of porosities which is relevant from a practical point of view? As the microstructure of cement-based materials is very complex in nature, it is not so easy to decouple the effects of every parameter. Thus, we first focus on a hydrated composite showing a much clearer morphology, even if at a much larger scale:1 gypsum. In the following, we would like to address whether the shape of the particles is a second order parameter with respect to the porosity as far as the effective stiffness is concerned, referring to both experimental and theoretical (numerical and semi-analytical) results. Then, in a second step, we go back to cementitious materials, starting with the effective properties of pure C\textendash S\textendash H.},

Essential information on crack near-tip fields and crack opening displacements is nonetheless available, while intuitive adaption is required to obtain the full-field solutions. Investigating the cause of prevailing deficiencies inevitably leads to a critical review of classical works by Muskhelishvili or Westergaard.

Then, the homogenization scheme is based on a modified Mori\textendash Tanaka scheme for three-phase viscoelastic composites, which is validated with the exact analytical formulation in the case of spherical composite inclusions and isotropic behaviors for all constituents. The comparison of the proposed coated inclusion-based homogenization scheme based on the RDI model with the exact analytical solution shows a significant improvement compared to the one based on the DI model in the prediction of effective properties for composites with interphases.

Highly sophisticated constituttive models have been developed and are employed in the scientific world. However, practical engineers very often prefer relatively simple elastic-perfectly plastic material models. In this paper the response of frequently used failure criteria, namely different forms of the Drucker-Prager criterion, are investigated by solving a simple earth pressure problem. The study reveals that all Drucker- Prager models represent a poor approximation of the Mohr-Coulomb failure surface and may lead to higher computing costs. This fact is well acknowledged by the scientific community but is nevertheless often ignored in practice. The results presented here strongly suggest that for earth pressure problems a proper Mohr-Coulomb failure surface should be used when the application of more refined models is not possible or justified.}

  abstract = {Il est connu depuis le d\'ebut du 20\`eme si\`ecle que les structures en b\'eton (arm\'ees, pr\'econtraintes) se d\'eforment au cours du temps. Ces d\'eformations dues au fluage et au retrait du b\'eton, ainsi qu'\'eventuellement \`a la relaxation des aciers de pr\'econtrainte, engendrent des probl\'ematiques de qualit\'e de service pour les usagers et peuvent amener \`a des redistributions de contraintes dans la structure. Cet article illustre ces ph\'enom\`enes \`a l'\'echelle des ponts de Savines et de Chevir\'e. Ceux-ci ont \'et\'e choisis d'une part pour les effets spectaculaires des d\'eformations observ\'ees et d'autre part pour la quantit\'e importante de mesures disponibles. L'objet de l'\'etude est de comparer les mesures in-situ aux fl\`eches th\'eoriques calcul\'ees sur la base des lois de dimensionnement actuelles. La comparaison montre que, au moins pour ces ponts, ces lois sous-estiment syst\'ematiquement les d\'eformations \`a long terme. Afin d'anticiper le comportement prochain de l'ouvrage, il est alors essentiel d'adapter ces lois afin de pr\'edire les d\'eformations futures et par cons\'equent les \'eventuelles redistributions d'efforts permettant ainsi d'identifier les maintenances ad\'equates. Ce rapport pr\'esente une des adaptations possibles des lois et discute des hypoth\`eses utilis\'ees, en particulier de l'\'evolution des fonctions de fluage et de retrait pour le b\'eton mais \'egalement de celle de la fonction de relaxation des aciers.},

The constructed approximation also constitutes approximate connection between the first Eshelby's problem (the eigenstrain problem) and the second one (the inhomogeneity problem), for non-ellipsoidal shapes.

  abstract = {The theory of anisotropic elasticity was originally motivated by applications to crystals, where geometric symmetries hold with high precision. In contrast, symmetries of the effective elastic responses of heterogeneous materials are usually approximate due to various imperfections of microgeometry. A related issue is that available data on the elastic constants may be incomplete or imprecise; it may be appropriate to select the highest possible elastic symmetry that fits the data reasonably well. Some of these problems have been discussed in literature in the context of specific applications, primarily in geomechanics. The present work provides a systematic discussion of the related issues, illustrated by examples on the effective elastic properties of heterogeneous materials. We also discuss a special type of orthotropy typical for a variety of heterogeneous materials - elliptic orthotropy - when the fourth-rank tensor of elastic constants can be represented in terms of a certain symmetric second-rank tensor. This representation leads, in particular, to reduced number of independent elastic constants. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

These issues are illustrated on the example of one specific shape factor: concavity-convexity of the inhomogeneity shape. It is found, in particular, that the effect of the concavity factor depends on the specific constraint imposed. If the inhomogeneity volume is kept constant, then its compliance contribution rapidly increases with increasing concavity; on the computational side it leads to difficulties related to unusually high requirements to the accuracy of the computed volume averages quantities. If, on the other hand, the characteristic dimensions (for example, the distance between the farthest points) are kept constant, then the dependence of the compliance contribution on the concavity factor is almost linear. \textcopyright 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {In heterogeneous materials, inhomogeneities (pores, cracks, particles) usually represent a mixture of diverse shapes. In modeling the effective elastic and conductive properties, they are often replaced by identical spheroidal shapes - for which exact solutions are available - that intend to represent certain "average shape" (for cracks, for example, the circular shape is routinely used). We find that, in anisotropic cases of non-random orientations, such a replacement cannot generally be done (with the exception of flat cracks). In other words, the concept of "average spheroid' is not legitimate, and its use may lead to large errors in predicting the effective properties - information on shape distribution is needed. In cases of overall isotropy, the replacement is possible in certain cases; even in these cases, however, the aspect ratio of the "average shape" may not be intuitively obvious.\textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Mode I fracture toughness (KIc) assessment procedure is presented in this study for semi-circular bend configuration. The geometrical factor f(a/w) is determined through 2D and 3D FEM simulations assuming linear elastic behavior. Parametric analyses have been done to evaluate the sensitivity of f(a/w) to the Poisson's ratio ({$\nu$}), specimen thickness (t) and position of the Gauss points where the vertical displacements are computed. The FEM analysis shows that f(a/w) is more sensitive to {$\nu$} in plane strain condition (thick specimens) than plane stress condition (thin specimen). Moreover, f(a/w) decreases slightly when ``t'' increases from 15 to 75 mm. In addition, f(a/w) evaluated from 3D FEM is slightly higher than that obtained in 2D configuration. The results also show that f(a/w) decreases when the position of the Gauss point is chosen far from the crack tip. Full factorial experimental program has been designed to evaluate the potential influence of: reclaimed asphalt (RA) content, loading rate and temperature on the fracture toughness (KIc) and the total fracture energy (Wf). The results show that the influent parameters on the KIc can be ranked from the most important to the least one as follows: loading rate, temperature and RA content. They also show that temperature is the most influent parameter on Wf, while the loading rate is the least influent one. KIc and Wf results have been modeled by polynomial functions.},

  abstract = {Grain-scale local fluid flow is an important loss mechanism for attenuating waves in cracked fluid-saturated poroelastic rocks. In this study, a dynamic elastic modulus model is developed to quantify local flow effect on wave attenuation and velocity dispersion in porous isotropic rocks. The Eshelby transform technique, inclusion-based effective medium model (the Mori-Tanaka scheme), fluid dynamics and mass conservation principle are combined to analyze pore-fluid pressure relaxation and its influences on overall elastic properties. The derivation gives fully analytic, frequency-dependent effective bulk and shear moduli of a fluid-saturated porous rock. It is shown that the derived bulk and shear moduli rigorously satisfy the Biot-Gassmann relationship of poroelasticity in the low-frequency limit, while they are consistent with isolated-pore effective medium theory in the high-frequency limit. In particular, a simplified model is proposed to quantify the squirt-flow dispersion for frequencies lower than stiff-pore relaxation frequency. The main advantage of the proposed model over previous models is its ability to predict the dispersion due to squirt flow between pores and cracks with distributed aspect ratio instead of flow in a simply conceptual double-porosity structure. Independent input parameters include pore aspect ratio distribution, fluid bulk modulus and viscosity, and bulk and shear moduli of the solid grain. Physical assumptions made in this model include (1) pores are inter-connected and (2) crack thickness is smaller than the viscous skin depth. This study is restricted to linear elastic, well-consolidated granular rocks.},

If the distance turns out to be positive, the algorithm provides a measure to see how close it is to this symmetry class. Moreover, the closest element of this class to it is also determined. This applies in cases where the tetrad is not ideal due to scattering of its measurement. The algorithm is entirely algebraic and applies to all symmetry classes, although the isotropic and the cubic class need a different treatment from all other classes.},

  abstract = {It is well known that the viscoelastic properties of polymer glasses are significantly influenced by a physical aging process. Although one expects this phenomenon to be operative for polymer matrix composites, very little data at present exist in the literature on the subject. In this paper, the linear viscoelastic creep behaviors of a unidirectional fiber reinforced plastic and its corresponding resin are presented with special emphasis on elucidating the influence of physical aging. It is found that physical aging causes a significant reduction in the creep of these systems and that its influence is comparable in magnitude to that of the temperature. The temperature and aging dependencies of the viscoelastic shift rate, an important quantity needed for long term viscoelastic predictions, are discussed. Further, the time-temperature superposition principle is shown to be unsuitable when applied to long term creep results but is perfectly applicable to momentary creep results. Finally, theoretical predictions of long term creep from momentary creep master curves using an effective time theory are shown to be within 5\% of experimental results.}

  abstract = {The effective behavior of matrix-inclusion materials is governed by the properties and volume fractions of involved material phases as well as by the morphology of the inclusion domain. Eshelby's solutions on the ellipsoidal inclusion problem (Eshelby, 1957) paved the way to the development of a vast number of continuum micromechanics based homogenization schemes for evaluation of effective properties. This paper proposes an approach for utilizing these homogenization schemes also for non-ellipsoidal inclusions with particular focus on macroscopic isotropy. The key concept is to replace the originally-used Eshelby tensor by an analogous representation capturing the effect of non-spherical inclusions on strain fluctuation within the material domain. The so-called replacement Eshelby tensor is obtained by numerical evaluation of two adjustment factors being functions of the inclusion morphology and the stiffness contrast between the matrix and inclusion phase. These factors are evaluated and discussed for selected inclusion morphologies. Finally, the replacement Eshelby tensor approach is implemented in a homogenization procedure for effective elastic properties (cascade continuum micromechanics model (Timothy and Meschke, 2016)) as well as in a scheme for determining effective yield surfaces in case of plastic material behavior (Traxl and Lackner, 2015).},

The consequences of anisotropic monocrystal behaviour on the elastic behaviour of polycrystals composed of randomly oriented grains (crystal aggregates) are explored using a three dimensional spherical analysis together with the analytical methods of Voigt [1889] and Reuss [1929], and comments made on the consequences of non-randomly oriented grains.},

  abstract = {Effective moduli of a two-dimensional anisotropic solid with elliptical holes having an arbitrary (non-random) orientational distribution are given in closed form. The results are derived in the non-interacting approximation. Besides being rigorous at small defect densities, this approximation constitutes the basic building block for various approximate schemes. Proper tensorial parameters of defect density (dependent on ellipses' eccentricity and their orientations relative to the matrix anisotropy axes) are identified. When derived in terms of such parameters, expressions for the effective moduli cover, in a unified way, mixtures of holes of diverse eccentricities and arbitrary orientational distribution. A number of special cases (circles, cracks of various orientational distributions) are discussed. If the field of defects is "geometrically isotropic" (holes of the circular shapes, or randomly oriented cracks), it reduces the matrix anisotropy. \textcopyright 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

In this study, we propose an exhaustion model and an adapted work-hardening model to explain the long-term basic creep of concrete. In both models, the macroscopic creep strain originates from local microscopic relaxations. The two models differ in how the activation energies of those relaxations are distributed and evolve during the creep process. With those models, at least up to a few dozen MPa, the applied stress must not modify the rate at which those relaxations occur, but only enables the manifestation of each local microscopic relaxation into an infinitesimal increment of basic creep strain. The two models capture equally well several phenomenological features of the basic creep of concrete. They also make it possible to explain why the indentation technique enables the quantitative characterization of the long-term kinetics of logarithmic creep of cement-based materials orders of magnitude faster than by macroscopic testing. The models hint at a physical origin for the relaxations that is related to disjoining pressures.},

In particular, the non-interaction, Mori\textendash Tanaka, differential and self-consistent schemes are compared against the direct finite element simulations. The latter are performed on the periodic representative volume elements containing 30 strongly oblate spheroids representing the penny-shaped cracks. This work extends the existent results to a more general class of matrix materials \textendash{} orthotropic materials, which requires the ability to calculate the Eshelby tensor for an ellipsoid in non-isotropic matrix. In addition to the implementation of the integration procedure used for the Eshelby tensor calculation, this work also presents a variation of the Random Sequential Adsorption algorithm modified for periodic structures. Analysis of the results indicates that in the case of parallel nearly flat cracks (strongly oblate spheroids) the overall out-of-plane moduli are best predicted by the differential scheme. On the other hand, Mori\textendash Tanaka scheme should be used for estimation of the in-plane moduli. It also appears that as the cracks are inflated from strongly oblate spheroids to slightly deformed spheres, the best choice of the micromechanical scheme for the out-of-plane properties gradually shifts towards Mori\textendash Tanaka.},

The cracks considered are two-dimensional with nonblunted, tapered ends such that opposite faces are tangent to each other at points of contact. Under compression the cracks shorten by closing near the crack tips, the proportion of crack surface area in contact becoming gradually larger. Some cracks make contact between the crack tips, becoming multiple cracks. Normal stresses on the crack surface vary rapidly over the closed portions from zero near the open surfaces to a peak value at the original crack tip. Stresses remain finite everywhere. At a given load the effective rock compressibility due to arbitrarily shaped, tapered cracks depends only on crack length, giving results identical to a distribution of elliptical cracks of the same lengths. However, at different loads the varying length causes the modulus to vary. As a result, interpretation of features like porosity and modulus under varying applied stress will depend on the specific crack model chosen.},

An isotropic solid filled with a low concentration of planar elliptical cracks is used as a model. Young's modulus for an elastic solid containing cracks is less than that for an identical solid without cracks. The cracks close under increasing compressive stress, causing an increase in modulus. However, even when applied stress is sufficient to close all cracks, the modulus may still not be equal to that of solid material, since frictional sliding at crack faces can occur. It is shown that cracks which have slid do not immediately slide in the opposite sense when the load is lowered; thus Young's modulus for the material without cracks can be found by measuring the initial slope of the unloading part of the stress-strain curve of a cracked material.},

Thereby the resulting macrocell current is dependent on many different boundary conditions like driving voltage, concrete resistivity and the geometrical arrangement of anode and cathode. In order to investigate macrocell corrosion, the herein presented research work was carried out by laboratory experiments and additionally by numerical analyses. First the numerical simulations were calibrated by laboratory measurements and thereafter, a numerical parameter study was carried out to increase the available database and identify the impact of changes in single parameters. As the focus is on geometrical effects, all laboratory specimens and numerical models were designed to represent practical conditions with diverse geometrical arrangements, e.g., slabs or beams with localized depassivations. In addition, parameters like concrete resistivity, driving voltage and cathode to anode surface area ratios have been varied. Thereafter, all results were used to derive cell factors for a simple macrocell current estimation. The present status of the project will be presented and discussed.},

To investigate the microstructural basis for such a statistical model of compressive failure in a brittle rock, we consider the development of instability in a wing crack model and establish a methodology whereby the Weibull parameters can be inferred from microstructural data on microcrack density and length statistics for input into finite element simulations. Application of this methodology to six Yuen Long marble samples provides important insights into how different attributes of the microstructure may influence the progressive development of rock failure. The finite element simulations underscore the significant influence of microcrack length statistics, which has not been emphasized in continuum damage mechanics models that usually emphasize the roles of average crack size and crack density. The microstructural data indicate that strength heterogeneity increases with increasing grain size, and this plays a key role in lowering the uniaxial compressive strength, which contributes to the overall decrease of strength with increasing grain size. \textcopyright 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {We derive simple integral solutions for the Green's tensors and Eshelby tensor for a generally anisotropic and non-centrosymmetric micropolar material. The material properties of a micropolar medium are characterized by three fourth-order tensors, C, B and D, in which C relates the stress to the strain, D connects the couple stress to the curvature tensor, and B is the coupling tensor, linking the stress to the curvature tensor or the couple stress to the strain tensor. Here we find that when C and B tensors possess minor symmetry conditions, the Green's tensors for a general anisotropic micropolar medium can be derived in simple integral expressions. We note however that in our formulation there is no any restriction on the D tensor. Specifically, we will show that, under the conditions on the C and B tensors, the Green's tensors can be exactly expressed as a simple line integral over a unit circle, and that the Eshelby's tensors for a general ellipsoidal inclusion can be derived as surface integrals over a unit sphere, entirely analogous to those of the classical elasticity. The exact integral form of the tensors can be implemented with numerical integration procedures. We will demonstrate that our numerical solutions are in good accuracy compared with the existing solutions for simple situations. In the literature analytic Green's tensors are existed only for isotropic and non-centrosymmetric micropolar medium. The solutions derived here can serve as benchmark solutions for certain classes of anisotropic micropolar medium, and also can be used as an approximate solution for a micropolar medium with general material properties without any constraint conditions.},

  abstract = {This work presents a computational nonlinear homogenization approach, the starting point of which is a model order reduction method based on data-clustering. To this end, the micromechanical data from numerical experiments (snapshots) is analyzed in order to identify characteristic microstructural deformation patterns. These describe how the macroscopic strain typically localizes within the microstructure. The outcome of the procedure is a subdivision of the microstructure into a set of clusters of material points. Within each cluster the strain is then approximated as being constant. The mechanical problem is formulated in terms of a three-field Hashin\textendash Shtrikman type variational formulation which is based on the introduction of a linear-elastic reference medium. After discretization, most of the global unknowns can be eliminated via static condensation leaving the piecewise constant cluster strains as the primary unknowns. The resulting homogenization scheme includes, as special cases, the finite element method as well as Hashin\textendash Shtrikman and Talbot\textendash Willis type homogenization approaches with phase-wise constant trial fields (as well as related bounds). The limit case 'finite element method' allows to transfer knowledge from finite element technology and thus provides new strategies for the choice of the stiffness of the reference material. The method is applied to several nonlinear microstructures with different inclusion volume fractions and varying degree of anisotropy. The results are shown to be in good agreement with full-field FE-simulations. Furthermore, the method is used to compute a refined upper bound of the Talbot\textendash Willis type (compared to phase-wise constant trial fields), which converges to the finite element solution with increasingly refined discretization.},

However, it is an open problem with great significance how to determine the interfacial property in composite media with inclusions of complex geometry. By the stereological theory and the nearest-surface distribution functions, we first propose a theoretical framework to symmetrically present the interfacial volume fraction. In order to verify the interesting generalization, we simulate three-phase composite media by employing hard-core-soft-shell structures composed of hard mono-/polydisperse non-spherical particles, soft interfaces, and matrix. We numerically derive the interfacial volume fraction by a Monte Carlo integration scheme. With the theoretical and numerical results, we find that the interfacial volume fraction is strongly dependent on the so-called geometric size factor and sphericity characterizing the geometric shape in spite of anisotropic particle types. As a significant interfacial property, the present theoretical contribution can be further drawn into predicting the effective transport properties of composite materials.},

In this work, the authors devise a multiple-inclusion micromechanical model to predict the effective transport properties of multiphase porous composites, where spheroidal inclusions of diverse types are randomly dispersed in a homogeneous matrix. The multiple-inclusion model is then applied to estimate the effective diffusivity of four-phase porous composites containing impermeable particles, pores, highly permeable interphase and matrix. Specifically, the microstructural characteristics of pores, interphase and particles, and their physical properties are incorporated into the evaluation of the effective diffusivity of porous composites. It is shown that the present model leads the prediction of diffusivity of porous composites to reasonable accuracy by comparing with extensive experimental data. Moreover, utilizing the proposed model, we investigate the dependence of effective diffusivity of porous composites on the shape, volume fraction and size distribution of impermeable particles, the interphase thickness and volume fraction, and the porosity characterized by the hydration degree of cement and the water-cement ratio. The results reveal that the geometrical and physical properties of these components play a significant role in determining the diffusivity of porous composites. The multiple-inclusion model provides a powerful and convenient predictive toolkit for multiphase composite design and evaluation.},

  abstract = {The transport properties of cement-based composites, including solute diffusivity, electrical conductivity and water permeability, are regarded as durability indicators of cement-based composites. These transport properties are closely related to the microstructure, or rather to the pore structure of materials. Among all the microstructural aspects, the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) between the cement paste matrix and aggregates, and the air voids are believed to play an essential role in the transport properties. However, their impacts on the transport properties are difficult to be quantified. This paper develops a closed-form four-phase micromechanical model accounting for the local properties of ITZ and the saturation states of air voids. The effects of ITZ and air voids on the transport properties of cement-based composites are addressed quantitatively in the model. The Katz\textendash Thompson equation is reinterpreted by the model in particular. It is shown that the local properties of ITZ and volume fraction of aggregates act mutually on the overall transport properties, the influence of air voids depends significantly on the water saturation, and a critical saturation degree is found to be 1/3.},

Application on two sands shows the capability of the model to accurately reproduce the experimental results. When saturation degree is higher than the residual saturation degree Srr, the evolution of homogenized solute diffusion coefficient with respect to the saturation degree depends significantly on the connectivity of the capillary water. Below Srr, depending on the connectivity of the wetting layer, the homogenized solute diffusion coefficient within unsaturated sands decreases by 2-6 orders of magnitude with respect to that in bulk liquid water. The upper bound of the solute diffusion coefficient contributed by the water films is 4-6 orders of magnitude lower than that in bulk liquid water.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a new integral equation method is proposed based on elementary solutions and superposition principle to study multiple crack-hole problem under both remote and surface stresses. Several typical crack-hole problems are solved in order to compare the calculation results of interacting stress intensity factors (SIFs) obtained by the newly proposed method with those obtained by Green's function method, dislocation density method, finite element method and digital photo-elasticity method, and further to investigate the effect of loading conditions and crack-hole geometric parameters on SIFs. Research results show that there exists a neutral inclination angle {$\alpha$}0 of the crack (with x-axis) for eliminating the crack-hole interaction when {$\sigma$}x{$\infty$} {$\geq$} {$\sigma$}y{$\infty$}. Increase of {$\sigma$}x{$\infty$} is helpful for cracking arrest and the compressive stresses on crack and hole surfaces are helpful for crack propagation. In addition, the normal stress (p) on the crack surface only affects KI and {$\alpha$}0 of KI, while the normal stress (n) on the hole surface affects both KI and {$\alpha$}0 of KI, and KII and {$\alpha$}0 of KII. The hole radius (R) and the crack-hole spacing distance (t) have little effect on {$\alpha$}0 of KI and KII. The new integral equation method not only has almost the same calculation results of SIFs as the Green's function, dislocation density and finite element methods, but also has advantage of simplicity and wide applicability over Green's function and dislocation density methods in calculating the interacting SIFs of the cracks under both remote and surface stresses.},

The Green's functions for double forces and double forces with moment are derived and these are then used to solve the inclusion problem. The elastic field inside the inclusion is expressed in terms of the newtonian and biharmonic potential functions, which are similar to those needed for the solution in isotropic solids. Two more harmonic potential functions are introduced to express the solution outside the inclusion. The constrained strain inside the inclusion is uniform and the relation between the constrained strain and the misfit strain has the same characteristics as those of the Eshelby tensor for isotropic solids, namely, the coefficients coupling an extension to a shear or one shear to another are zero. The explicit closed form expression of this tensor is given. The inhomogeneity problem is then solved by using Eshelby's equivalent inclusion method. The solution for the thermoelastic displacements due to thermal inhomogeneities is also presented.},

  abstract = {Recent compilation of data on numerous large-span prestressed segmentally erected box girder bridges revealed gross underestimation of their multi-decade deflections. The main cause has been identified as incorrect and obsolete creep prediction models in various existing standard recommendations and is being addressed in a separate study. However, previous analyses of the excessive deflections of the Koror-Babeldaob (KB) Bridge in Palau and of four Japanese bridges have shown that a more accurate method of multi-decade creep analysis is required. The objective of this paper is to provide a systematic and comprehensive presentation, appropriate not only for bridges but also for any large creepsensitive structure. For each time step, the solution is reduced to an elastic structural analysis with generally orthotropic elastic moduli and eigenstrains. This analysis should normally be threedimensional (3-D). It can be accomplished with a commercial finite element code such as ABAQUS. Based on the Kelvin chain model, the integral-type creep law is converted to a rate-type form with internal variables, which account for the previous history. For time steps short enough to render aging during each step to be negligible, a unique continuous retardation spectrum for each step is obtained by Laplace transform inversion using simple Widder's formula. Discretization of the spectrum then yields the current Kelvin chain moduli. The rate-type creep analysis is computationally more efficient than the classical integral-type analysis. More importantly, though, it makes it possible to take into account the evolution of various inelastic and nonlinear phenomena such as tensile cracking, cyclic creep, and stress relaxation in prestressing tendons at variable strain, as well as the effects of humidity and temperature variations, and the effect of wall thickness variation on drying creep and shrinkage. Finally, the advantages compared to the existing commercial programs, based on step-by-step integration of memory integrals, are pointed out and illustrated by a simple example. \&copy; 2012, American Concrete Institute.},

  abstract = {The foundations of classical homogenization techniques, which aim at predicting the overall behavior of heterogeneous materials from that of their constituents, are reviewed. After introductory definitions and a methodological preamble, attention is focused on linear elasticity, for which the basic principles of estimating and bounding the overall properties are introduced and illustrated. In this context, special recourse is made for that to the solution of the inclusion and inhomogeneity problems as reported by Eshelby in 1957. Approaches proposed recently to account in a better way for the structural morphology of the considered materials are briefly mentioned. The case of linear elasticity with eigenstrains is then discussed: several applications, including heterogeneous thermoelasticity, can be investigated within this framework. Finally, outlines of nonlinear micromechanics are briefly reported from a historical point of view: from rate-independent elastoplasticity to nonlinear elasticity and viscoplasticity, examples of a fruitful interaction between the search for new estimates and the derivation of rigorous bounds are given and the crucial question of the description of intraphase heterogeneity is emphasized. Viscoelastic coupling and rate-dependent effects are briefly discussed in conclusion.},

  abstract = {Using Schwarz's alternating method and Muskhelishvili's complex variable function techniques, this paper presents an iterative algorithm method for the effective and accurate calculation of the stresses in an elastic solid of infinite extent containing multiple elliptic holes and subject to external loading at the infinity. The elliptic holes can have different dimensions and locate at any points while their axis orientations must be orthogonal. The proposed iterative algorithm method is based on the approximation of the resultant force vector on each elliptic hole boundary as a series of complex variable. As a result, exact closed-form analytical stress solutions can then be obtained for the solid with a single elliptic hole whose boundary is subject to the reverse resultant force vector in the forms of complex series. The numerical results presented in the paper show that the iterative solution converges quickly and stably. The proposed convergent criterion ensures the satisfaction of the required accuracy of the stress results. The stress concentration at elliptic holes can then be evaluated with high accuracy.},

  abstract = {Based on the observation that during long-term creep the viscosity of polymers will continue to increase due to physical aging, a new constitutive equation is derived to describe the long-term creep behavior of polymers that are chrono-rheologically simple. The theory is developed using the concept of effective time for such materials whose long-term creep compliances with various aging times are characterized by a horizontal shift on the log(t)-scale. The derivation makes use of the basic mathematical structure for such a horizontal shift, with a result that is both sufficient and necessary. A linear viscosity function is found to be required for such a material, and the corresponding shift rate for both the long-term creep and the short-time creep is found to increase with aging time te, reaching an asymptotic value of unity. This theory improves Struik's (1978) classic theory for the special class of chrono-rheologically simple materials, in that, when the aging time is sufficiently long, both theories are identical, but when it is short, the present one can account for the transition to the asymptotic state. The developed effective-time theory is then extended to a polymer\textendash matrix composite to predict the effect of physical aging on the long-term creep of a fiber-reinforced composite material.},

  abstract = {It is important to investigate the effects of heat conduction of crack interior on thermoelastic fields of a cracked material. In this paper, an extended thermal-medium crack model is proposed to address the influences of the thermal conductivity inside an opening crack on the induced thermoelastic fields. Then the problem of a penny-shaped crack in a transversely isotropic material is investigated under applied mechanical and uniform heat flow loadings. Based on the Hankel transform technique, the governing partial differential equations are transformed to ordinary differential equations, then to a system of coupled dual integral equations. The thermoelastic fields around the penny-shaped crack are obtained explicitly by solving the derived dual integral equations. Numerical results are reported to show the influences of the thermal conductivity of crack interior on partial insulation coefficient, temperature change across crack and thermal stress intensity factor. As compared to the known thermal-medium crack model, the proposed one exhibits more applicability.},
