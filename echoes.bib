  abstract = {This work aims at developing an efficient method to compute the compliance due to a crack modeled as a flat ellipsoid of any shape in an infinite elastic matrix of arbitrary anisotropy (Eshelby problem) when no closed-form solution seems currently available. Whereas the solution of this problem usually requires the calculation of the so-called fourth-order Hill polarization tensor if the ellipsoid is not singular, it is shown that the crack compliance can be derived from the first-order term in the Taylor expansion of the Hill tensor with respect to the smallest aspect ratio of the ellipsoidal inclusion. For a 3D ellipsoidal crack model, this first-order term is expressed as a simple integral thanks to the Cauchy residue theorem. A similar method allows to express the same term in the case of a cylindrical crack model without any integral. A numerical example is finally treated.},

  abstract = {It is supposed that a region within an isotropic elastic solid undergoes a spontaneous change of form which, if the surrounding material were absent, would be some prescribed homogeneous deformation. Because of the presence of the surrounding material stresses will be present both inside and outside the region. The resulting elastic field may be found very simply with the help of a sequence of imaginary cutting, straining and welding operations. In particular, if the region is an ellipsoid the strain inside it is uniform and may be expressed in terms of tabu­lated elliptic integrals. In this case a further problem may be solved. An ellipsoidal region in an infinite medium has elastic constants different from those of the rest of the material; how does the presence of this inhomogeneity disturb an applied stress-field uniform at large distances? It is shown that to answer several questions of physical or engineering interest it is necessary to know only the relatively simple elastic field inside the ellipsoid.},

Various approaches to the problem are discussed; they are further assessed by comparing their predictions to results for sample deterministic arrays. These computer experiments indicate that the approximation of non-interacting cracks has a wider than expected range of applicability. Some of the deficiencies of various approximate schemes seem to be related to inadequacy of the conventionally used crack density parameter (insensitive to mutual positions of cracks). An alternative parameter that has this sensitivity, is suggested. Finally, the problem of effective moduli is discussed in the context of “damage mechanics”. It is argued that, contrary to the spirit of many damage models, there is no direct quantitative correlation between progression of a microcracking solid towards fracture and deterioration of its stiffness; thus, the effective moduli may not always serve as a reliable indicator of damage.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses some basic problems in mechanics of elastic solids containing multiple cracks. A number of mathematical aspects that frequently constitute fields of their own (like various numerical techniques) are discussed very briefly in the chapter. The focus is on physically important effects produced by crack interactions and to present results in the simplest form possible. The problems considered in this chapter can be divided into two groups: (1) The impact of interactions on individual cracks, particularly on the stress intensity factors (SIFs), and (2) the effective elastic properties of solids with many cracks. Problems of the first group are, generally, relevant for the fracture-related considerations; solutions are sensitive to the positions of individual cracks. Problems of the second group deal with the volume average quantities; they are relatively insensitive to the information on individual cracks. The chapter discusses, in this connection, whether correlations exist between these two groups of quantities; in particular, whether microcracking can be reliably monitored by measuring changes in the effective elastic moduli. ©1994, Academic Press Inc.},

When the body is two-dimensional, we take advantage of Cauchy’s theory of residues to derive a new explicit expression which depends on the two pairs of complex conjugate roots of a quartic equation. If the body exhibits orthotropic symmetry, these roots are explicitly given as a function of the independent components of the elasticity tensor. Similarly, the double integral is reduced to a simple one when the body is three-dimensional. The corresponding integrand depends on the three pairs of complex conjugate roots of a sextic equation which reduces to a cubic one for orthotropic symmetry. This new expression improves significantly the computation times when the degree of anisotropy is high. For both two and three-dimensional bodies, degenerate cases are also studied to yield valid expressions in any events.},

  abstract = {Some of the greatest scientists including Poisson, Faraday, Maxwell, Rayleigh, and Einstein have contributed to the theory of composite materials. Mathematically, it is the study of partial differential equations with rapid oscillations in their coefficients. Although extensively studied for more than a hundred years, an explosion of ideas in the last five decades (and particularly in the last three decades) has dramatically increased our understanding of the relationship between the properties of the constituent materials, the underlying microstructure of a composite, and the overall effective (electrical, thermal, elastic) moduli which govern the macroscopic behavior. This renaissance has been fueled by the technological need for improving our knowledge  base of composites, by the advance of the underlying mathematical theory of homogenization, by the discovery of new variational principles, by the recognition of how important the subject is to solving structural optimization problems, and by the realization of the connection with the mathematical problem of quasiconvexification. This 2002 book surveys these exciting developments at the frontier of mathematics.},

  abstract = {The aim of this short paper is to provide, for elasticity tensors, generalized Euclidean distances that preserve the property of invariance by inversion. First, the elasticity law is expressed under a non-dimensional form by means of a gauge, which leads to an expression of elasticity (stiffness or compliance) tensors without units. Based on the difference between functions of the dimensionless tensors, generalized Euclidean distances are then introduced. A subclass of functions is proposed, which permits the retrieval of the classical log-Euclidean distance and the derivation of new distances, namely the arctan-Euclidean and power-Euclidean distances. Finally, these distances are applied to the determination of the closest isotropic tensor to a given elasticity tensor.},

Applications are illustrated by solving the rate problem for an inhomogeneity in a large volume of a comparison medium, which is shown to be readily adaptable to standard averaging techniques for predictions of rates of change of overall moduli of composite materials experiencing evolution of phase moduli. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The calculations are simplified immensely, and ensuing physical analyses are well prepared for, once the structure of every algebra is unravelled completely in terms of a number of separate subalgebras isomorphic to familiar algebras such as the binary one of the complex numbers, the quaternary one of the 2x2 matrices and the octonary one of the complex quaternions. The fourth-rank tensors do not seem to have been submitted previously to the present algebraic point of view, and nor do those of any other rank: a parallel, but less intricate, development can be provided for the second-rank ones.},

  abstract = {The foundations of classical homogenization techniques, which aim at predicting the overall behavior of heterogeneous materials from that of their constituents, are reviewed. After introductory definitions and a methodological preamble, attention is focused on linear elasticity, for which the basic principles of estimating and bounding the overall properties are introduced and illustrated. In this context, special recourse is made for that to the solution of the inclusion and inhomogeneity problems as reported by Eshelby in 1957. Approaches proposed recently to account in a better way for the structural morphology of the considered materials are briefly mentioned. The case of linear elasticity with eigenstrains is then discussed: several applications, including heterogeneous thermoelasticity, can be investigated within this framework. Finally, outlines of nonlinear micromechanics are briefly reported from a historical point of view: from rate-independent elastoplasticity to nonlinear elasticity and viscoplasticity, examples of a fruitful interaction between the search for new estimates and the derivation of rigorous bounds are given and the crucial question of the description of intraphase heterogeneity is emphasized. Viscoelastic coupling and rate-dependent effects are briefly discussed in conclusion.},
