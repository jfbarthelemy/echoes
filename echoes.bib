Whereas the solution of this problem usually requires the calculation of the so-called fourth-order Hill polarization tensor if the ellipsoid is not singular, it is shown that the crack compliance can be derived from the first-order term in the Taylor expansion of the Hill tensor with respect to the smallest aspect ratio of the ellipsoidal inclusion. For a 3D ellipsoidal crack model, this first-order term is expressed as a simple integral thanks to the Cauchy residue theorem. A similar method allows to express the same term in the case of a cylindrical crack model without any integral. A numerical example is finally treated.},

  abstract = {It is supposed that a region within an isotropic elastic solid undergoes a spontaneous change of form which, if the surrounding material were absent, would be some prescribed homogeneous deformation. Because of the presence of the surrounding material stresses will be present both inside and outside the region. The resulting elastic field may be found very simply with the help of a sequence of imaginary cutting, straining and welding operations. In particular, if the region is an ellipsoid the strain inside it is uniform and may be expressed in terms of tabu­lated elliptic integrals. In this case a further problem may be solved. An ellipsoidal region in an infinite medium has elastic constants different from those of the rest of the material; how does the presence of this inhomogeneity disturb an applied stress-field uniform at large distances? It is shown that to answer several questions of physical or engineering interest it is necessary to know only the relatively simple elastic field inside the ellipsoid.},

When the body is two-dimensional, we take advantage of Cauchy’s theory of residues to derive a new explicit expression which depends on the two pairs of complex conjugate roots of a quartic equation. If the body exhibits orthotropic symmetry, these roots are explicitly given as a function of the independent components of the elasticity tensor. Similarly, the double integral is reduced to a simple one when the body is three-dimensional. The corresponding integrand depends on the three pairs of complex conjugate roots of a sextic equation which reduces to a cubic one for orthotropic symmetry. This new expression improves significantly the computation times when the degree of anisotropy is high. For both two and three-dimensional bodies, degenerate cases are also studied to yield valid expressions in any events.},

This renaissance has been fueled by the technological need for improving our knowledge  base of composites, by the advance of the underlying mathematical theory of homogenization, by the discovery of new variational principles, by the recognition of how important the subject is to solving structural optimization problems, and by the realization of the connection with the mathematical problem of quasiconvexification.

First, the elasticity law is expressed under a non-dimensional form by means of a gauge, which leads to an expression of elasticity (stiffness or compliance) tensors without units. Based on the difference between functions of the dimensionless tensors, generalized Euclidean distances are then introduced. A subclass of functions is proposed, which permits the retrieval of the classical log-Euclidean distance and the derivation of new distances, namely the arctan-Euclidean and power-Euclidean distances. Finally, these distances are applied to the determination of the closest isotropic tensor to a given elasticity tensor.},

  abstract = {Bounds of Hashin-Shtrikman type and self-consistent estimates for the overall properties of composites, which may be anisotropic, are developed. Bodies containing aligned ellipsoidal inclusions are considered particularly, generalizing previously known results. The overall thermal conductivity of a body containing aligned spheroidal inclusions is discussed as an example including, as limiting cases, bodies containing highly-conducting aligned needles and bodies containing aligned pennyshaped cracks.},

  abstract = {The foundations of classical homogenization techniques, which aim at predicting the overall behavior of heterogeneous materials from that of their constituents, are reviewed. After introductory definitions and a methodological preamble, attention is focused on linear elasticity, for which the basic principles of estimating and bounding the overall properties are introduced and illustrated. In this context, special recourse is made for that to the solution of the inclusion and inhomogeneity problems as reported by Eshelby in 1957. Approaches proposed recently to account in a better way for the structural morphology of the considered materials are briefly mentioned. The case of linear elasticity with eigenstrains is then discussed: several applications, including heterogeneous thermoelasticity, can be investigated within this framework. Finally, outlines of nonlinear micromechanics are briefly reported from a historical point of view: from rate-independent elastoplasticity to nonlinear elasticity and viscoplasticity, examples of a fruitful interaction between the search for new estimates and the derivation of rigorous bounds are given and the crucial question of the description of intraphase heterogeneity is emphasized. Viscoelastic coupling and rate-dependent effects are briefly discussed in conclusion.},
