# Introduction {#sec-intro}

# Crack opening displacement and compliance tensors {#sec-BH}

This section recalls important definitions and results as regards the calculation of tensors quantifying the compliant effect induced by the presence of an elliptical or cylindrical crack in a solid matrix. Geometrically, an elliptical crack is defined as an interface $\symcal{I}^\text{ell}$ of equation
$$
\x\cdot\n=0
\quad\textrm{and}\quad
\left(\x\cdot\uv{ℓ}\right)^2+
\left(\frac{\x\cdot\uv{m}}{η}\right)^2
\leq a^2
\quad(\symcal{I}^\text{ell})
$${#eq-ellipticalcrack}
where $\x$ is the position vector, $\n$ the unit vector normal to the crack plane,
$\uv{ℓ}$ and $\uv{m}$ are unit vectors directed along respectively the major and minor axes, $a$ is the major radius and $η≤1$ is the aspect ratio of the ellipse so that $b=η\,a$ is the minor radius.
The case of a cylindrical crack $(\symcal{I}^\text{cyl})$ is given by the following geometrical definition invariant along the direction $\uv{ℓ}$
$$
\x\cdot\n=0
\quad\textrm{and}\quad
\lvert \x\cdot\uv{m} \rvert \leq b
\quad(\symcal{I}^\text{cyl})
$${#eq-cylindricalcrack}

In order to exploit results of Eshelby's problem [@eshelby1957] in the sequel, it proves useful to consider that an elliptical crack is the limit of an ellipsoid (see @fig-crack-ellip) of equation
$$
\x\cdot(\trans{\uu{A}}\cdot\uu{A})^{-1}\cdot\x\leq 1
\quad\textrm{with}\quad
\uu{A}=a\,\left(
\uv{ℓ}\otimes\uv{ℓ}+
η\,\uv{m}\otimes\uv{m}+
ω\,\n\otimes\n\right)
$${#eq-ellipsoid}
when the smallest aspect ratio $ω=\frac{c}{a}$ tends towards $0$.
Similarly the cylindrical crack is obtained as the limit of a 3D cylinder of elliptical section (see @fig-crack-cylind)
$$
\x\cdot(\trans{\uu{A}}\cdot\uu{A})^{†}\cdot\x\leq 1
\quad\textrm{with}\quad
\uu{A}=b\,\left(
\uv{m}\otimes\uv{m}+
ρ\,\n\otimes\n\right)
$${#eq-cylinder}
when the aspect ratio $ρ=\frac{c}{b}$ of the section tends towards $0$ and $(\trans{\uu{A}}\cdot\uu{A})^{†}$ is the generalized inverse of $\trans{\uu{A}}\cdot\uu{A}$, namely
$$
(\trans{\uu{A}}\cdot\uu{A})^{†}=
\frac{1}{b^2}\,\left(
\uv{m}\otimes\uv{m}+
\frac{1}{ρ^2}\,\n\otimes\n\right)
$${#eq-pseudoinversetAA}

::: {.callout-warning}
Given the length $b$, the cylindrical crack of equation (@eq-cylindricalcrack) can be seen as the limit of an ellipsoid of equation (@eq-ellipsoid) when both the large radius $a$ tends towards infinity and the smallest radius $c$ tends towards $0$. However the order in which the limits are taken is of great importance since it has an impact on the ratio between the surface $S$ of the crack seen as an interface and the volume $V$ of the 3D crack which tends to the interface. Indeed, in the case of an ellipsoid, this ratio is
$$
κ^\text{ell}=
\frac{S^\text{ell}}{V^\text{ell}}=\frac{π\,a\,b}{\frac{4}{3}\,π\,a\,b\,c}=\frac{3}{4\,c}
$${#eq-SVell}
whereas the same ratio writes for a cylinder
$$
κ^\text{cyl}=
\frac{S^\text{cyl}}{V^\text{cyl}}=\frac{2\,b\,L}{π\,b\,c\,L}=\frac{2}{π\,c}
$${#eq-SVcyl}
In (@eq-SVcyl), the intermediate length $L$ plays the role of the cylinder length assumed to tend towards infinity and $κ^\text{cyl}$ can also be defined as the ratio between the width of the crack $2\,b$ and the cross section surface $π\,b\,c$.
From the comparison between (@eq-SVell) and (@eq-SVcyl), it is obvious that considering a cylinder of length $L$ tending towards infinity is not equivalent to making the major radius $a$ of an ellipsoid tend towards infinity as regards this surface/volume ratio. However as shown later this ratio is important to establish the correspondence between Eshelby's result [@eshelby1957] for 3D inhomogeneity and the interface behavior.

Models of cracks
:::

A single open crack is embedded in an infinite elastic matrix of stiffness tensor $\uuuu{C}$ and subjected to a remote stress tensor $\Sig$. The action of the loading induces a crack opening displacement (COD) defined as a displacement discontinuity $\uv{u}^+-\uv{u}^-$ between points located on opposite lips of the crack and initially coincident ($\uv{u}^+$ denotes the displacement on the lip directed towards $+\n$ called upper lip in the sequel and $\uv{u}^-$ on the lower lip).
A normalized COD is also introduced such that he length which divides the COD depends on the crack model: either $a$ for an elliptical crack defined in (@eq-ellipticalcrack) or $b$ for a cylindrical crack defined in (@eq-cylindricalcrack)
$$
\cod=\frac{\uv{u}^+-\uv{u}^-}{a}\;(\symcal{I}^\text{ell})
\quad\text{or}\quad
\cod=\frac{\uv{u}^+-\uv{u}^-}{b}\;(\symcal{I}^\text{cyl})
$${#eq-normCOD}
Besides the notations for averaging over the crack are introduced
$$
<\cod>_{\symcal{I}^\text{ell}}=\frac{∫_{\symcal{I}^\text{ell}}\cod \ud S}{π\,a^2\,η}
\;(\symcal{I}^\text{ell})
\quad\text{;}\quad
<\cod>_{\symcal{I}^\text{cyl}}=\frac{∫_{y=-b}^b \cod \ud S}{2\,b}
\;(\symcal{I}^\text{cyl})
$${#eq-avnormCOD}
where it is assumed that, in the case of a cylindrical crack, the field $\cod$ defined over the crack surface is invariant in the direction of the cylinder axis so that the average is obtained by integrating over the transverse in-plane direction.

Due to the linearity of the problem and by invoking the principle of superposition --- showing that the deformation of the crack would be the same if the remote stress $\Sig$ was replaced by a uniform traction $\Sig⋅\n$ (resp. $-\Sig⋅\n$) applied on the upper (resp. lower) lip of the crack ---, the average COD can linearly be related to $\Sig⋅\n$ thanks to the second-order COD tensors $\uu{B}^\text{ell}$ and $\uu{B}^\text{cyl}$ ([@kachanov1992], [@kachanov1993])
$$
<\cod>_{\symcal{I}^\text{ell}}=\uu{B}^\text{ell}⋅\Sig⋅\n
\quad\text{;}\quad
<\cod>_{\symcal{I}^\text{cyl}}=\uu{B}^\text{cyl}⋅\Sig⋅\n
$${#eq-B}
Focusing now on the ellipsoidal geometry, the open crack is considered as an ellipsoidal pore for which Eshelby's solution [@eshelby1957] can apply. This fundamental result states that the strain tensor within the ellipsoidal pore $\symcal{E}$ induced by the application of the remote stress $\Sig$ writes
$$
∀\x ∈ \symcal{E},\; \eps=\uuuu{Q}^{-1}:\Sig
\quad\text{with}\quad
\uuuu{Q}=\uuuu{C}-\uuuu{C}:\uuuu{P}:\uuuu{C}
$${#eq-Q}

$\sig$
